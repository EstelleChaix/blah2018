(AGAMOUS-like 15), a member of the MADS-domain family of regulatory factors, accumulates preferentially in the organs and tissues derived\nfrom double fertilization in flowering plants (i.e. the embryo, suspensor, and endosperm). The developmental role of AGL15\nis still undefined. If it is involved in embryogenesis rather than some other aspect of seed biology, then AGL15 protein should\naccumulate whenever development proceeds in the embryonic mode, regardless of the origin of those embryos or their developmental\ncontext. To test this, we used AGL15-specific antibodies to analyze apomictic embryogenesis in dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), microspore embryogenesis in oilseed rape (Brassica napus), and somatic embryogenesis in alfalfa (Medicago sativa). In every case, AGL15 accumulated to relatively high levels in the nuclei of the embryos. AGL15 also accumulated in cotyledon-like\norgans produced by thextc2(extracotyledon2) mutant of Arabidopsis and during precocious germination in oilseed rape. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of AGL15\nappeared to be developmentally regulated in all embryogenic situations. AGL15 was initially present in the cytoplasm of cells\nand became nuclear localized before or soon after embryogenic cell divisions began. These results support the hypothesis that\nAGL15 participates in the regulation of programs active during the early stages of embryo development.\nIn seed plants, the sporophyte generation initiates with a unique developmental phase: the seed or embryo phase. During this\nphase, morphogenetic programs operate to establish the correct embryo form, storage reserves accumulate, desiccation tolerance\nis acquired, and a quiescent state is established that can be exited in a controlled manner at a later point. The early stages\nof embryo development have been difficult to study because the cells constituting the embryo are small, few in number, and\nembedded in several layers of maternal tissues. Much progress has been made recently in isolating genes encoding regulatory\nfactors expressed during early embryogenesis (Li and Thomas, 1998; Lotan et al., 1998; Luerssen et al., 1998; for reviews of other genes, see Mordhorst et al., 1997; Berleth, 1998); however, relatively little is known about the corresponding gene products in terms of activity and\/or regulation.\nAlthough it is not restricted to embryos, the MADS-box regulatory factor AGL15(AGAMOUS-like15) is expressed at approximately 10-fold higher levels during the embryonic phase than during any other phase of the life cycle\n(Heck et al., 1995; Rounsley et al., 1995). Members of the MADS-domain family contain a highly conserved, 55- to 60-amino acid motif (the MADS domain) that functions\nas both a DNA-binding and dimerization domain (for review, see Riechmann and Meyerowitz, 1997). MADS-domain proteins are found in plants, animals, and fungi and often play critical roles in the control of development.\nIn Arabidopsis and snapdragon, for example, proteins such as APETALA1\/SQUAMOSA, AGAMOUS\/PLENA, APETALA3\/DEFICIENS,andPISTILLATA\/GLOBOSA\nplay central roles in the specification of meristem and floral organ identity (for review, see Riechmann and Meyerowitz, 1997). MADS-box gene families are quite large in plants but not in animals and fungi. At least 15 different members may be present\nin ferns (Münster et al., 1997) and more than 28 have already been identified in Arabidopsis (Riechmann and Meyerowitz, 1997). AGL15 is one of the most divergent members of the family in Arabidopsis (Rounsley et al., 1995) and is the only member isolated to date that is expressed preferentially during embryogenesis.\nAGL15-specific antibodies and immunohistochemistry were used previously to demonstrate that AGL15 accumulation and localization\nare developmentally regulated during zygotic embryogenesis. AGL15 accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells of the female germ\nunit before fertilization and moves into the nuclei after the first few cell divisions in the embryo, suspensor, and endosperm\n(Perry et al., 1996). Relatively high levels of AGL15 are maintained in the embryo nuclei throughout the period of morphogenesis and then decline\nas the embryo matures. Based on this accumulation pattern and the fact that it is similar in dicot and monocot embryos, we\nhave proposed that AGL15 plays a conserved regulatory role during the early stages of the embryonic phase (Heck et al., 1995; Perry et al., 1996). If this role is important for the process of embryogenesis, AGL15 should accumulate in the nuclei in all young embryos\nand new embryonic organs regardless of when and how they initiate. To test this idea, we used AGL15-specific antibodies to\nexamine a variety of developmental situations in a variety of flowering plants in which embryos or embryonic organs arise\noutside of the seed context or by means other than the fertilization of an egg. In every case we found that whenever embryos\nor embryonic organs were present, relatively high levels of AGL15 could be detected in the nuclei.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"6f03482","id":"815b41f","subj":"1165b38"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7586beff","id":"5542c4ed","subj":"1165b38"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4c12331b","id":"6150c3ec","subj":"1165b38"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"5b7a5baa","id":"44c03695","subj":"1d296da"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"5b12b668","id":"662ac478","subj":"1165b38"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7c7a06ec","id":"3eb25e1a","subj":"5b7a5baa"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"3b69e7d1","id":"233795b6","subj":"1165b38"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"776aec5c","id":"3eb738bb","subj":"5b7a5baa"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"587e5365","id":"ae13544","subj":"4009e306"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4988d8b8","id":"3d34d211","subj":"4009e306"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"702657cc","id":"17f7cd29","subj":"45752059"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"6c6cb480","id":"13b6aecc","subj":"557caf28"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"65e98b1c","id":"158a8276","subj":"4116aac9"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"75d4a5c2","id":"3c3d9b6b","subj":"22555ebf"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4116aac9","id":"79d8407f","subj":"279fedbd"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"75d4a5c2","id":"5fbe4146","subj":"3c46e67a"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"557caf28","id":"1e66f1f5","subj":"36ebc363"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"75d4a5c2","id":"4e50c791","subj":"206a70ef"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"557caf28","id":"7530ad9c","subj":"c730b35"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"557caf28","id":"58a9760d","subj":"292b08d6"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"75d4a5c2","id":"399c4be1","subj":"408d971b"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"71e9ddb4","id":"1573f9fc","subj":"394df057"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"45752059","id":"7e6f74c","subj":"38425407"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"394df057","id":"31190526","subj":"33c911a1"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"4009e306","id":"6743e411","subj":"22fcf7ab"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"3fc2959f","id":"477b4cdf","subj":"10683d9d"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"4e08711f","id":"f5958c9","subj":"2cd76f31"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"66d18979","id":"5bda8e08","subj":"305b7c14"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"7bedc48a","id":"7eac9008","subj":"131ef10"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"45752059","id":"6ed3ccb2","subj":"43bc63a3"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"10683d9d","id":"15de0b3c","subj":"682b2fa"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"45c7e403","id":"45b4c3a9","subj":"4116aac9"},{"pred":"Occurs_During","obj":"74235045","id":"dd05255","subj":"192c3f1e"},{"pred":"Occurs_During","obj":"5c671d7f","id":"179ece50","subj":"192c3f1e"},{"pred":"Occurs_During","obj":"30c15d8b","id":"3cd3e762","subj":"192c3f1e"},{"pred":"Occurs_During","obj":"49e5f737","id":"62ddbd7e","subj":"192c3f1e"},{"pred":"Exists_At_Stage","obj":"4009e306","id":"6a78afa0","subj":"c0c2f8d"},{"pred":"Exists_At_Stage","obj":"6989da5e","id":"2f4948e4","subj":"5aa9e4eb"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"4afcd809","id":"77c2494c","subj":"3754a4bf"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6c6cb480","id":"1a677343","subj":"6025e1b6"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"2d1ef81a","id":"3857f613","subj":"206a70ef"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6c6cb480","id":"198b6731","subj":"2d1ef81a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"2d1ef81a","id":"bcec361","subj":"22555ebf"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6025e1b6","id":"40005471","subj":"22555ebf"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"36ebc363","id":"55fe41ea","subj":"2d1ef81a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6025e1b6","id":"fbd1f6","subj":"36ebc363"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6025e1b6","id":"1ce24091","subj":"3c46e67a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6025e1b6","id":"5dda768f","subj":"292b08d6"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6025e1b6","id":"7a8c8dcf","subj":"c730b35"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"3c46e67a","id":"510f3d34","subj":"2d1ef81a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"408d971b","id":"7817fd62","subj":"2d1ef81a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"75db5df9","id":"8297b3a","subj":"707194ba"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"2d1ef81a","id":"2362f559","subj":"c730b35"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"2d1ef81a","id":"4c178a76","subj":"292b08d6"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6025e1b6","id":"fa4c865","subj":"206a70ef"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6025e1b6","id":"544fa968","subj":"408d971b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6025e1b6","id":"5b94b04d","subj":"557caf28"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"557caf28","id":"4c39bec8","subj":"2d1ef81a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"75d4a5c2","id":"f79e","subj":"2d1ef81a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"75d4a5c2","id":"1f59a598","subj":"6025e1b6"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"6c40365c","id":"489115ef","subj":"7d20d0b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"7770f470","id":"302552ec","subj":"61322f9d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj

every situation in which embryogenesis was newly initiated, we have seen a change in the localization of AGL15 or AGL15-related\nprotein. We demonstrated previously that localization of AGL15 was developmentally regulated in zygotic embryos of oilseed\nrape (Perry et al., 1996) and found that a similar change in subcellular localization, from cytoplasmically associated to nuclear associated, occurred\nat the start of embryogenesis in the asexual embryos of dandelion. Therefore, the change in epitope localization does not\nappear to be tied in any obligatory way to a fertilization event. The maternal environment also appears to be dispensable.\nIn the alfalfa somatic embryo culture system, immunoreactive protein was initially present in the cytoplasm of leaf mesophyll\ncells and became exclusively localized in the nuclei even before somatic embryo development was apparent. These results indicate\nthat the change in the localization of AGL15-related proteins is not dependent on information from maternal tissues of the\nseed.\nThe importance of subcellular localization as a mechanism for regulation of transcription factors is increasingly being recognized\n(for review, see Calkhoven and Ab, 1996; Jans and Hübner, 1996;Vandromme et al., 1996). In addition to AGL15, there are other plant MADS-domain proteins that show differential localization. In snapdragon, DEFH125\nwas present in the cytoplasm in the vegetative cell of pollen grains but was present in the nuclei of cells in the transmitting\ntissue of the upper portion of the style after pollination (Zachgo et al., 1997). Regulation of localization may be tied to heterodimer formation in the case of the Arabidopsis MADS-domain proteins AP3\n(APETALA3) and PI (PISTILLATA). In plants that ectopically express AP3 protein fused to the reporter GUS, GUS activity was\nconfined to the cytoplasm unless the appropriate partner (PI in this case) was also present (McGonigle et al., 1996). Similarly, fusions between PI and GUS were cytoplasmically localized unless AP3 was present (McGonigle et al., 1996). Unlike AP3-PI, AGL15 could bind DNA as a homodimer in vitro (Perry et al., 1996). Therefore, the formation of a heterodimer between AGL15 and another MADS-domain protein may not be a prerequisite for nuclear\nimport.\nIn the alfalfa somatic embryo system, the developmentally regulated change in subcellular localization of AGL15-related epitopes\ncoincided with a change in the apparent molecular mass from 40 kD to between 56 and 60 kD. Although it is possible that the\nmajor immunoreactive protein bands represent proteins that are unrelated to AGL15, we consider this unlikely, based on the\nhigh degree of specificity that the antibodies displayed and the correspondence between the abundance, expression pattern,\nand localization of the immunoreactive proteins in alfalfa and those of AGL15 in other species. Alfalfa had two very distinct\nforms of AGL15-related proteins that were both present during the period when vegetative tissue (leaf) was making a transition\nto embryogenesis. It is intriguing that precociously germinating oilseed rape embryos, which were also in a state of developmental\ntransition, contained two forms of immunoreactive protein as well (Fig. 3d).\nIn alfalfa, the shift in molecular mass was coincident with and may reflect a regulatory event that was tied to the change\nin subcellular localization. This shift could involve degradation of the cytoplasmic form and synthesis of a new nuclear form,\npossibly via alternate splicing to generate a new transcript. Alternatively, the cytoplasmic form may be posttranslationally\nmodified in some way. Possible posttranslational modifications include dimerization, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and\/or\nattachment of ubiquitin-like proteins (Calkhoven and Ab, 1996; Jans and Hübner, 1996; Vandromme et al., 1996;Haltiwanger et al., 1997; Johnson and Hochstrasser, 1997). We will be investigating these and other possibilities in future studies to determine the basis of the change in molecular\nmass in both alfalfa and oilseed rape and its relationship to subcellular localization.\nIn summary, we have shown that AGL15 or AGL15-related proteins accumulated at higher levels in the nuclei whenever a set of\ncells developed in an embryonic mode, regardless of their origin or the particular developmental situation.

expression of AGL15 produced a limited number of effects, effects that were distinct from those reported for other MADS domain factors. CaMV\n35S promoter\u2013driven expression of AP1 (Mandel and Yanofsky 1995b) or AG (Mizukami and Ma 1992) or AP3 plus PISTILLATA (Krizek and Meyerowitz 1996) leads to early flowering and the production of leaves with upwardly curling margins; expression of AGL15 by way of this promoter does not. Expression of floral MADS domain factors in inappropriate contexts in reproductive tissues\nleads to changes in the identity of the meristems and floral organs (Mandel et al. 1992a ; Mizukami and Ma 1992 ; Jack et al. 1994 , Jack et al. 1997). In plants with moderate constitutive expression, AGL15 accumulated in nuclei throughout the flower with no apparent effect\non organ identity or morphogenesis.\nThe lack of effects on floral morphogenesis suggests that AGL15 maintains some degree of specificity for regulatory targets\neven when it is overexpressed. If excess AGL15 competed for and indiscriminately occupied the DNA binding sites of the floral\nMADS domain proteins, we would expect to see major perturbations throughout the reproductive phase. Instead, we saw that overexpression\nof AGL15 primarily affected tissues in which we had detected both AGL15 promoter activity and protein accumulation in wild-type plants. We cannot completely eliminate the possibility that some\naspects of the overexpression phenotype are the result of newly acquired functions (i.e., AGL15 binding to new target genes\nin new tissues). However, given the transient nature of AGL15 expression in most wild-type tissues, at least some of the phenotypic changes may result from temporal extensions of the\nnormal functions of the AGL15 gene product (i.e., AGL15 acting on target genes for longer periods).\nWhen AGL15 was constitutively expressed, the transition to flowering was delayed and the vegetative phase was extended by ~6 days under\ninductive, long-day

and biochemical approaches have been used to identify and clone regulators of seed development and ABA signaling. The ABI loci of Arabidopsis cloned to date can be divided into genes encoding two major classes of biochemical function: protein phosphatases (ABI1 and ABI2), and transcription factors (ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5). These loci have been well characterized in terms of their roles in marker gene expression and ABA sensitivity of growth, by analysis of mutants and transgenic ectopic expression lines, both singly and in various combinations (Finkelstein and Lynch, 2000; Finkelstein et al., 1998; Parcy and Giraudat, 1997; Parcy et al., 1994; Söderman et al., 2000). These studies have shown that ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5 have similar physiological roles and show some cross-regulation of expression, leading to the suggestion that they act combinatorially. In contrast, the effects of the dominant negative abi1-1 mutation have relatively limited overlap with those of mutations in ABI3, ABI4 or ABI5. Although double mutants combining abi1-1 with any of the transcription factor mutations show significantly enhanced resistance to ABA (Finkelstein, 1994; Finkelstein and Somerville, 1990), suggesting action in separate pathways, the abi1-1 mutation can block the ABA hypersensitivity produced by overexpression of ABI3, consistent with action in the same pathway (Parcy and Giraudat, 1997).\nConsequently, ABI1, ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5 were all legitimate candidates for proteins that might be involved in direct physical interactions. We have tested for such interactions among these ABI gene products by yeast two-hybrid assays; as this is a completely heterologous system, any apparent interactions should be dependent on the plant genes included in the assay. Despite the apparent similarities of the genetic interactions involving ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5, only two of the ABI proteins interact in this assay: ABI3 and ABI5. Recent studies have shown that ABI5 interacts synergistically with ABA and co-expressed VP1 to transactivate an Em-GUS reporter in transfected rice protoplasts, providing further support for the hypothesis that these proteins interact in plant cells (Gampala et al., 2001). The failure of ABI1 to interact with any of the transcription factors might reflect either a simple lack of physical interaction between these proteins, or a requirement for a phosphorylated substrate which is not provided by heterologous expression in yeast. The lack of interaction between ABI4 and any of the other ABIs, despite the observed similarities in genetic interactions and physiological effects, does not exclude the possibility of participating in the same regulatory complex, but does show that these factors are probably not in direct contact. We have mapped the ABI3\u2013ABI5 interaction to the B1 domain of ABI3 and a region of ABI5 containing two conserved charged domains, and several possible sites of ser\/thr phosphorylation. In addition, ABI5 can form homodimers; this interaction appears to be dependent on a weakly conserved hydrophilic domain as well as the bZIP domain. ABI5\/AtDPBF1 homodimer formation has also been demonstrated by in vitro binding to the Dc3 promoter (T. Thomas, Texas A & M University, personal communication).\nThe functional domains of ABI3 and its homologs, for example, the VP1 proteins of cereals, have been analyzed in terms of their roles in DNA binding and transactivation of target promoters. These studies have shown that the B2 domain is involved in regulation of some late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) and storage protein genes (Bies-Etheve et al., 1999), and enhances DNA binding of a variety of bZIP factors, but binds DNA only weakly and non-specifically by itself. In contrast, the B3 domain can bind DNA directly (Suzuki et al., 1997), but is not required for ABA-dependent gene regulation (Carson et al., 1997). Both the B2 and B3 domains were recently shown to be necessary for expression of a Brassica napus gene encoding the storage protein napin, apparently by interaction with distinct cis-elements, leading the authors to suggest that B2 tethers ABI3 to a seed-specific ABRE via protein\u2013protein interactions (Ezcurra et al., 2000). Two-hybrid screens for proteins interacting with oat VP1 or Arabidopsis ABI3 using bait constructs containing only the B2 and B3 domains identified several transcription factors, but did not result in isolation of an ABI5 fusion (Jones et al., 2000; Kurup et al., 2000). In contrast, a two-hybrid screen using the B1 and B2 domains of the rice OSVP1 in the bait construct identified TRAB-1 (Hobo et al., 1999), a rice bZIP factor with strong homology to ABI5 (55% similar). Although the interacting domains of TRAB-1 and OSVP1 were not specifically mapped, these results are consistent with the importance of the B1 domain to the interaction.\nThe functional domains of ABI5 are less well characterized. ABI5 belongs to a subfamily of the bZIP transcription factor family whose members have been identified by mutation (Finkelstein and Lynch, 2000; Lopez-Molina and Chua, 2000), one-hybrid screens with repeats of the ABRE motif (Choi et al., 2000; Uno et al., 2000) or a fragment of the Dc3 promoter (Kim et al., 1997); or a two-hybrid screen with OSVP1 as \u2018bait\u2019 (Hobo et al., 1999). Within this subfamily, expression patterns vary in terms of relative abundance in seed versus vegetative tissues or induction by salt, drought or ABA, but all appear correlated with ABA response. To date, the only member of the family for which mutants have been identified is ABI5. The most severe available mutations result in truncation at aa 361 (abi5-1) (Finkelstein and Lynch, 2000) or after only 110 amino acids of the wild-type coding sequence (abi5-4) (Lopez-Molina and Chua, 2000); the former includes all but the bZIP domain, while the latter is lacking all but the first conserved charged domain. However, both mutant lines show similar, limited ABA resistance and comparable effects on seed gene expression, suggesting that both are effectively null mutations. Given that both lack the bZIP domain required for dimerization and DNA binding, this result is neither surprising nor informative regarding other potentially important domains. In contrast, deletion analyses of the sunflower DPBF-1 protein have shown that in vitro DNA binding is retained in constructs lacking one or all three of the charged domains in the amino half of the protein (Kim et al., 1997). This implies that the region of DPBF-1 corresponding to amino acids 1\u2013248 of ABI5 is not required for homodimer formation. Although sunflower DPBF-1 shows the strongest overall homology to ABI5 of all sequences currently in the database, the Arabidopsis ABF\/AREB proteins share with ABI5 a larger conserved region at the amino-terminal end. In our studies, this conserved region appears to function as a transcription-activation domain. Although a truncation including only the most conserved part of this domain (aa 64\u2013122) still functions as an activator, it is attenuated approximately twofold relative to the construct including amino acids 9\u2013122. Recently, all three of the conserved domains in the amino-terminal halves of AREB1 and AREB2 were shown to undergo ABA-dependent phosphorylation in an in-gel kinase assay (Uno et al., 2000). Furthermore, transactivation of reporter genes in protoplasts required the presence of both an AREB and ABA, but could be blocked by protein kinase inhibitors, implying that ABA-dependent phosphorylation is essential for activity of the AREBs. However, in vivo phosphorylation of the AREBs has not been assayed directly.\nTaken together with our two-hybrid interaction results, these studies suggest that the transcription-activation domain of ABI5 is located in the most amino-terminal conserved domain, but is normally inactive until phosphorylation induces a conformational change that exposes the domain to potential interaction partners. In our truncation studies, removal of surrounding domains by deletion of their coding regions might produce the same effect as that suggested for phosphorylation: exposure and resulting transcription-activation function in yeast. In contrast, the second and third conserved domains appear more significant in interacting with ABI3, but have no intrinsic activator function of their own. We do not know whether this interaction depends on phosphorylation of the BD-ABI5 truncations in yeast, but they are certainly not exhibiting ABA-dependent phosphorylation in this system. Analysis of the predicted protein structure for ABI5 shows that the three conserved regions in the amino half have a relatively low probability of being exposed on the surface compared with adjacent domains in the primary structure. This is consistent with a requirement for a phosphorylation-induced conformational change to expose the transcription activation and ABI3-interacting domains.\nThe studies described above all use the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to target transcription activation due to any interacting proteins to a GAL4-responsive promoter. To determine whether any of the ABI-transcription factors could interact directly with a known ABI-responsive plant promoter in a completely heterologous system, we tested their ability to activate an AtEm6::lacZ fusion in yeast. The promoter fragment used contains two consensus binding sites (ACACNNG) for the sunflower homologs of ABI5 (Kim et al., 1997) within ≈230 bp of the transcription start site, and it is likely that the observed activation by ABI5 reflects binding to these sites. In contrast, intact ABI3 (or VP1) has never been shown to bind directly to DNA, so the failure of ABI3 to transactivate the reporter gene is not surprising. Similarly, although ABI4 belongs to the EREBP\/DREB\/CBF subfamily of the APETALA2 domain family of transcription factors, most of which were identified by binding to similar DNA sequences, a binding site for ABI4 has not yet been identified. The failure of ABI4 to transactivate the AtEm6::lacZ reporter suggests that an ABI4 binding site either is not contained within this 1.3 kb fragment, or is too far from the transcription start site to efficiently recruit RNA polymerase to initiate transcription of this gene.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7e5afaa6","id":"a2431d0","subj":"5403f35f"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"73e22a3d","id":"1cbb87f3","subj":"47faa49c"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7e5afaa6","id":"1b6e1eff","subj":"429bffaa"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"70e9c95d","id":"7fee8714","subj":"130c12b7"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7bab3f1a","id":"2b91004a","subj":"26e356f0"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"18df8434","id":"169e6180","subj":"130c12b7"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"27f981c6","id":"22ef9844","subj":"26e356f0"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"6404f418","id":"6283d8b8","subj":"316bcf94"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4d465b11","id":"290222c1","subj":"28f2a10f"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"53fdffa1","id":"4b8ee4de","subj":"4d465b11"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"6221a451","id":"1b11171f","subj":"2e3967ea"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"5562c41e","id":"1151e434","subj":"4d465b11"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"6221a451","id":"2dc54ad4","subj":"51c668e3"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"6221a451","id":"4659191b","subj":"a38c7fe"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"49c7b90e","id":"534a5a98","subj":"342c38f8"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"73700b80","id":"4f80542f","subj":"49c7b90e"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4d5b6aac","id":"121314f7","subj":"49c7b90e"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"49c7b90e","id":"5e600dd5","subj":"3e84448c"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"6392827e","id":"537f60bf","subj":"49c7b90e"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"73e22a3d","id":"65c7a252","subj":"f736069"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"49c7b90e","id":"229c6181","subj":"2ed2d9cb"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7e5afaa6","id":"1a4013","subj":"483f6d77"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"483f6d77","id":"2c1b194a","subj":"429bffaa"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5403f35f","id":"4dbb42b7","subj":"483f6d77"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7a419da4","id":"66f57048","subj":"ea6147e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"3bf9ce3e","id":"550dbc7a","subj":"156b88f5"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"70e9c95d","id":"6d4e5011","subj":"18df8434"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"6404f418","id":"57d7f8ca","subj":"60bd273d"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"306e95ec","id":"78123e82","subj":"f736069"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"6d3a388c","id":"67c33749","subj":"223aa2f7"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"7a419da4","id":"76c3e77a","subj":"1e683a3e"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"576d5deb","id":"fba92d3","subj":"54e1c68b"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"5f9b2141","id":"662b4c69","subj":"22e357dc"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"6c130c45","id":"fa49800","subj":"2fd1433e"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"50ad3bc1","id":"71238fc2","subj":"48974e45"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"5d534f5d","id":"55634720","subj":"a38c7fe"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"5d534f5d","id":"4b0d79fc","subj":"2e3967ea"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"4d0f2471","id":"428640fa","subj":"28f2a10f"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"5d534f5d","id":"d9345cd","subj":"51c668e3"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"793be5ca","id":"2d710f1a","subj":"15aab8c6"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"6fdbe764","id":"2d52216b","subj":"a38c7fe"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"6fdbe764","id":"3f6f6701","subj":"2e3967ea"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"4d0f2471","id":"3527942a","subj":"f736069"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"37654521","id":"942a29c","subj":"15aab8c6"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"6fdbe764","id":"1ed6388a","subj":"51c668e3"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"69997e9d","id":"5a45133e","subj":"15aab8c6"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"53fdffa1","id":"4229bb3f","subj":"28f2a10f"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"63a12c68","id":"2fb3536e","subj":"28f3b248"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"5562c41e","id":"35aea049","subj":"28f2a10f"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"212b5695","id":"7205765b","subj":"d29f28"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"6c130c45","id":"47987356","subj":"932bc4a"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"47faa49c","id":"48f278eb","subj":"f736069"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"7bd4937b","id":"a530d0a","subj":"5b03b9fe"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"4d5b6aac","id":"5acf93bb","subj":"10d307f1"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"505fc5a4","id":"6cd28fa7","subj":"bd4dc25"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"3e84448c","id":"4738a206","subj":"10d307f1"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"54e1c68b","id":"66d3eec0","subj":"52b1beb6"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"505fc5a4","id":"1e04fa0a","subj":"25084a1e"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"25084a1e","id":"1af2d44a","subj":"bd4dc25"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"576d5deb","id":"18d87d80","subj":"52b1beb6"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6392827e","id":"618425b5","subj":"43dac38f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"71a8

AP2 and\na TTG1 complex with a bHLH protein (candidates include EGL3 and\/or TT8) and a tissue-specific MYB transcription factor activate\nGL2 and TTG2. GL2 acts upstream of MUM4. In contrast, both TTG2 and MYB61 appear to affect aspects of mucilage production independent from MUM4. For details, see text.\nCorrect regulation of MUM4 transcription at the time of mucilage production does not require TTG2 or MYB61 (Fig. 7A). However, TTG1 is required to activate TTG2 in the seed coat (Fig. 7C) and in other tissues (Johnson et al., 2002). This result places TTG2 downstream from TTG1 in a second pathway that controls mucilage biosynthesis in the developing seed. This alternate pathway, along with another\nthat involves MYB61, may regulate the expression of other proteins involved in RGI synthesis including an NDP-d-GlcUA 4-epimerase (Feingold, 1982; Reiter and Vanzin, 2001), a nucleotide sugar transporter or an RGI-backbone glycosyltransferase. Alternatively, MYB61 and TTG2 may be involved in the transport of newly synthesized RGI to the plasma membrane. Feedback inhibition of mucilage production\nin the absence of secretion has been demonstrated in the root caps of the maize (Zea mays) mutant Ageotropic (Millar and Moore, 1990).\nAP2 encodes a putative transcription factor that is required for the differentiation of the outer two layers of the seed coat\n(Western et al., 2001). Not surprisingly, ap2 seeds lack mucilage and fail to activate MUM4 transcription beyond its baseline level of expression (Fig. 7A). Although AP2 is required for maximum GL2 and TTG2 transcript levels (Fig. 7B), transcription of TTG1 and MYB61 was independent of AP2 activity (Fig. 7B). Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that AP2 functions in parallel with TTG1 to activate GL2 and TTG2 in the seed coat epidermis (Fig. 8).\n","relations":[{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"54422e18","id":"f78a47e","subj":"3e27ba32"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"46cdf8bd","id":"644baf4a","subj":"f0c8a99"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7ef82753","id":"7526515b","subj":"2cf3d63b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"3e27ba32","id":"1ed4ae0f","subj":"173ed316"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"543295b0","id":"54c5a2ff","subj":"3e27ba32"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"79e4c792","id":"6d4d66d2","subj":"17f9d882"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"2a7f1f10","id":"2a265ea9","subj":"f0c8a99"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7ef82753","id":"11392934","subj":"7674f035"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"710c2b53","id":"6892b3b6","subj":"2ddc9a9f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7674f035","id":"6e6f2380","subj":"3e27ba32"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"740cae06","id":"76a4ebf2","subj":"2a7f1f10"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"2ddc9a9f","id":"53fe15ff","subj":"298a5e20"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7ef82753","id":"5149d738","subj":"76b1e9b8"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"3e27ba32","id":"6bbe85a8","subj":"2cf3d63b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"740cae06","id":"3a7442c7","subj":"46cdf8bd"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7ef82753","id":"4be29ed9","subj":"543295b0"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7ef82753","id":"548d708a","subj":"54422e18"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"53fb3dab","id":"4b013c76","subj":"1c5920df"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7ef82753","id":"cb0755b","subj":"173ed316"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"4681c175","id":"712625fd","subj":"48bb62"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"53fb3dab","id":"742ff096","subj":"350aac89"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"79e4c792","id":"15043a2f","subj":"4c60d6e9"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"3f191845","id":"1349883","subj":"196a42c3"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"3f191845","id":"4b29d1d2","subj":"3ba987b8"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"75437611","id":"d737b89","subj":"350aac89"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"75437611","id":"8519cb4","subj":"1c5920df"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"4c60d6e9","id":"35dab4eb","subj":"17f9d882"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"75437611","id":"2d901eb0","subj":"53fb3dab"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"26d9b808","id":"48075da3","subj":"f0c8a99"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"740cae06","id":"7a35b0f5","subj":"26d9b808"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"7674f035","id":"2e8c1c9b","subj":"543295b0"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"7674f035","id":"449a4f23","subj":"2cf3d63b"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"2cf3d63b","id":"1530c739","subj":"173ed316"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"543295b0","id":"5b1669c0","subj":"2cf3d63b"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"7674f035","id":"78e4deb0","subj":"117159c0"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"76b1e9b8","id":"6e9175d8","subj":"2cf3d63b"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"2cf3d63b","id":"7d0b7e3c","subj":"117159c0"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"76b1e9b8","id":"15bb5034","subj":"7674f035"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"7674f035","id":"25ce9dc4","subj":"173ed316"},{"pred":"Regulates_Molecule_Activity","obj":"72035809","id":"69e153c5","subj":"5afa3c9"},{"pred":"Regulates_Molecule_Activity","obj":"909217e","id":"563f38c4","subj":"5afa3c9"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"72cc7e6f","id":"17f62e33","subj":"5afa3c9"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"606e4010","id":"27406a17","subj":"8458f04"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5f049ea1","id":"2af004b","subj":"196a42c3"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5f049ea1","id":"248e319b","subj":"3ba987b8"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5032714f","id":"5d0bf09b","subj":"48bb62"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5b218417","id":"793f29ff","subj":"2cb4893b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"72cc7e6f","id":"2034b64c","subj":"72035809"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"58cbafc2","id":"75d3a5e0","subj":"235ecd9f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"18271936","id":"74d1dc36","subj":"8458f04"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"58cbafc2","id":"74e28667","subj":"1ca3b418"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5f049ea1","id":"68c9133c","subj":"3f191845"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"413d1baf","id":"5e2c3d18","subj":"2cb4893b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"1a75e76a","id":"3e8c3cb","subj":"16eb3ea3"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"cc43f62","id":"7161d8d1","subj":"8458f04"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"2a7f1f10","id":"7f485fda","subj":"26d9b808"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"46cdf8bd","id":"28261e8e","subj":"26d9b808"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"54422e18","id":"1cf6d1be","subj":"117159c0"},{"pred":"Is_Involved_In_Process","obj":"72cc7e6f","id":"663c9e7a","subj":"909217e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"353352b6","id":"19e4653c","subj":"57a78e3"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"353352b6","id":"795509d9","subj":"2767e23c"},{"pred":"Is_Me

Reciprocal cross experiments showed that AP2 acts maternally to control seed mass. The maternal effect of AP2 on seed mass involves the regulation of both embryo cell number and cell size. We show further that ap2 mutations cause changes in the ratio of hexose to sucrose during seed development, opening the possibility that AP2 may control seed mass through its effects on sugar metabolism.

organ formation in higher plants relies on the activity of stem cell niches in shoot and root meristems where\ndifferentiation of the resident cells is repressed by signals from surrounding cells. We searched for mutations affecting\nstem cell maintenance and isolated the semidominant l28 mutant, which displays premature termination of the shoot meristem and differentiation of the stem cells. Allele competition\nexperiments suggest that l28 is a dominant-negative allele of the APETALA2 (AP2) gene, which previously has been implicated in floral patterning and seed development. Expression of both WUSCHEL (WUS) and CLAVATA3 (CLV3) genes, which regulate stem cell maintenance in the wild type, were disrupted in l28 shoot apices from early stages on. Unlike in floral patterning, AP2 mRNA is active in the center of the shoot meristem and acts via a mechanism independent of AGAMOUS, which is a repressor of WUS and stem cell maintenance in the floral meristem.

in higher plants can be divided conceptually into two distinct phases. Early in embryogenesis, during the morphogenesis\nphase, the basic body plan of the plant is established with regional specification of apical\u2013basal and radial domains from\nwhich morphological structures derive, fixation of polarity from specification of the shoot-root axis, and formation of embryonic\ntissue and organ systems (1\u20133). The morphogenesis phase is followed temporally by the maturation phase, although the two phases can overlap (4, 5). During the maturation phase, embryo cell-division rates decline markedly, embryo cells acquire the ability to withstand\ndesiccation, and embryo cell growth occurs, with the accumulation of storage reserves that comprise lipids and proteins in\nArabidopsis (6, 7). At the end of the maturation phase, the embryo becomes quiescent metabolically as the seed desiccates.\nThe maturation phase can be viewed as an interruption of an ancestral life cycle, as occurs in lower plants, in which there\nare no periods of maturation or dormancy separating the end of embryogenesis and the beginning of postembryonic development\n(4). Evolution of this unique mode of embryogenesis has enabled higher plants to make seeds. The ability to make seeds has provided\ntremendous selective advantages that, in part, account for the success of the angiosperms (8, 9). Little is known at a mechanistic level about the processes by which the maturation phase has been integrated into the higher\nplant life cycle.\nLEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2), along with ABA INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), and FUSCA3 (FUS3), have been implicated to be major regulators\nof the maturation phase (reviewed in ref. 5). The LEC2 protein contains a DNA-binding B3 domain that is most closely related to that of FUS3 and ABI3 (10\u201312). The lec2 mutation causes localized defects in embryo filling, seed protein accumulation, and desiccation tolerance (12, 13). LEC2 expression is normally limited primarily to seed development, although LEC2 RNA may be present at very low levels at other stages of the life cycle (12). Ectopic expression of LEC2 causes accumulation of seed storage lipids and proteins in vegetative organs (ref. 14, and S.L.S., S. L. Paula, L. W. Kwong, J. E. Meuser, J. Pelletier, R.L.F., R.B.G., and J.J.H., unpublished work). The function\nof LEC2 is not limited to the maturation phase. The lec2 mutation causes defects during the morphogenesis phase, and ectopic LEC2 expression induces somatic embryo formation from vegetative cells (12, 13). Furthermore, the lec2 mutation severely compromises the ability of Arabidopsis explants to form somatic embryos (15). These observations suggest that LEC2 plays several roles during embryogenesis, indicating that it is a central regulator\nof embryo development.\nTo gain insight into the role of LEC2 in embryogenesis, we have identified genes regulated by the LEC2 transcription factor.\nWe show that a subset of genes activated by LEC2 is expressed predominantly during the maturation phase, and several have\nknown roles in maturation processes. Several of these maturation genes are also expressed early in embryogenesis.

However, our demonstration that induction of LEC2 causes rapid increases in the expression\nof many maturation genes indicates that LEC2 can activate maturation processes directly.\nMany LEC2-induced RNAs are directly involved in storage reserve accumulation, a hallmark of the maturation phase. These RNAs\ninclude 2S and 12S storage proteins, oleosin, and steroleosin, an abundant oil body protein that shares similarity with the\nanchoring hydrophobic domain of oleosin and contains a sterol-binding domain (21, 28). Another LEC2-induced maturation RNA encodes a regulator of reserve accumulation, EEL. This bZIP transcription factor works\nin cooperation with ABI3 and ABI5 to regulate expression of the Em gene that encodes an abundant seed protein

has previously been shown that Arabidopsis thaliana ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AtEBP) contributed to resistance to abiotic stresses. Interestingly, it has also been reported that expression of ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) genes including AtEBP were regulated by the activity of APETALA2 (AP2), a floral homeotic factor. AP2 is known to regulate expression of several floral-specific homeotic genes such as AGAMOUS. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between AP2 and AtEBP in gene expression.\nMethods Northern blot analysis was performed on ap2 mutants, ethylene-related Arabidopsis mutants and transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing AtEBP, and a T-DNA insertional mutant of AtEBP. Phenotypic analysis of these plants was performed.\nKey Results Expression levels of ERF genes such as AtEBP and AtERF1 were increased in ap2 mutants. Over-expression of AtEBP caused upregulation of AP2 expression in leaves. AP2 expression was suppressed by the null-function of ethylene-insensitive2 (EIN2), although AP2 expression was not affected by ethylene treatment. Loss of AtEBP function slightly reduced the average number of stamens.\nConclusions AP2 and AtEBP are mutually regulated in terms of gene expression. AP2 expression was affected by EIN2 but was not regulated by ethylene

terminal domain of AGL15 contains two conserved motifs, one of which is a putative repression motif\nComparison of amino acid sequences of class-II ERF repressors revealed the conservation of the sequence motif L \/FDLN L \/F(x)P, designated as the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, and mutational analysis demonstrated that this motif is essential for repression (Ohta et al., 2001). A similar motif was also identified in a number of zinc-finger proteins from a variety of species (Ohta et al., 2001), and in some Aux\/IAA proteins (Tiwari et al., 2004) that function as repressors. Here we demonstrate that the repressive capacity of AGL15 was dependent on the presence of the C-terminal domain containing the LxLxL motif (Figure 3c), and that the LxLxL motif was required for the interaction of AGL15 with SAP18 (Figure 4). AtSAP18 has also been shown to interact with ERF3 and ERF4 (Song and Galbraith, 2006), which contain the motifs FQFDLNFPP and LDLDLNLPP, respectively.\nSAP18 did not interact with any of the other MADS-domain proteins we tested, which is unsurprising given that the interaction occurs at least in part via the divergent C-terminal domain and not only via the highly conserved MADS or moderately conserved I and K domains. However, SAP18 did not interact, at least in yeast, with the closest relative of AGL15, AGL18, which also contains a similar LxLxL motif (DTSLQLGLSS) and exhibits functional redundancy in planta with AGL15 (Adamczyk et al., 2007). However, no AGL18-interacting partners have been demonstrated using the yeast system in our lab, or have been reported in the literature, even though such experiments have been performed (de Folter et al., 2005; Verelst et al., 2007). The literature contains a number of examples where a full-length MADS-domain protein, when fused to the GAL4-DBD, is unable to interact with partners with which truncated forms do interact (Fujita et al., 2003; Yang and Jack, 2004; Yang et al., 2003a,b). However, a truncated form of AGL18 lacking the MADS domain also failed to interact with any of the AGL15-interacting proteins (K. Hill, unpublished data). There are examples where an interaction shown to occur between full-length MADS in planta does not occur in the yeast system (Immink et al., 2002), and could reflect a conformation effect brought about by the GAL4-DBD fusion masking some interactions. SAP18 also did not interact with a form of SVP that lacks the MADS domain but has an LxLxL motif within the C-terminal domain (data not shown). This may reflect the involvement of the K domain in mediation of the AGL15\u2013SAP18 interaction that is only weakly conserved in primary structure between MADS MIKC proteins. The last member of the Arabidopsis MADS family with a similar LxLxL motif, AGL24, was not tested in the yeast system for interaction with SAP18 because it is not expressed in embryonic tissue (Lehti-Shiu et al., 2005).

biological role of the AGL15\u2013SAP18 interaction\nAGL15 accumulates in the nuclei of cells in the embryo beginning very early in development (by the eight-cell stage for Arabidopsis) and remains at relatively high levels into maturation, decreasing during desiccation (Perry et al., 1996). AGL15 is expressed after germination in Arabidopsis, in the vegetative shoot apical meristem, but not at the transition to reproductive development, although it is once again expressed at the bases of cauline leaves and floral organs (Fernandez et al., 2000). The level of expression in these tissues is generally at least 10-fold lower than that found in the embryo (Fernandez et al., 2000; Heck et al., 1995). One possible role for AGL15 is in regulating developmental transitions during the plant life cycle. The expression data supports this hypothesis. Ectopic overexpression of AGL15 via the 35S promoter causes delays at many points in the life cycle, including late flowering, a longer period for seeds to mature, and delayed senescence and abscission (Fernandez et al., 2000). Additionally, 35S:AGL15 transgenic lines show increased capability for cultured zygotic embryos, and for apical meristem tissue in a liquid culture system, to form somatic embryos (Harding et al., 2003). One possible explanation is that these tissues are delayed in exiting embryonic programs. Recently, a double mutant agl15 agl18 was documented to flower early under short-day conditions (Adamczyk et al., 2007). Epigenetic control is one means by which developmental transitions are regulated (for a review, see Berger and Gaudin, 2003Henderson and Dean, 2004; Boss et al., 2004). Therefore, interaction of AGL15 with chromatin-modifying proteins is very intriguing.\nPhenotypes reported as being associated with HDA19 overexpression include decreased acetylation of histones, short siliques, abnormal cotyledons and leaves, late flowering and decreased fertility (Zhou et al., 2005). Some of these phenotypes, notably late flowering, have also been documented in plants that constitutively express AGL15 (Fernandez et al., 2000). However, both antisense HDA19 transgenic and athd-t1 homozygous lines have also been reported to cause a delay in flowering, in some cases observable only when plants are grown under long-day conditions (Tian and Chen, 2001; Tian et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2000). In agreement with the latter observation, treatment of Arabidopsis plants with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A also induces a late flowering effect (Wu et al., 2000). Also consistent with these results is the observation that a loss-of-function allele of fld, a component of an HDAC complex, results in hyperacetylation of histones associated with FLC, increased transcript abundance of FLC and a late flowering phenotype (He et al., 2003). However, loss-of-function of the histone acetyltransferase AtHAC1 also results in increased transcript abundance of FLC and a delay in flowering, perhaps caused by the regulation of components upstream of FLC (Deng et al., 2007).\nDespite the fact that SAP18 is a single-copy gene, highly conserved even between plants and animals, plants homozygous for null alleles of sap18 are viable and do not exhibit any obvious phenotype until the plant is stressed (Song and Galbraith, 2006). Similarly Drosophila homozygous for null sap18 alleles are able to complete their life cycle (Singh et al., 2005). AGL15 is able to interact directly with at least one other member of the SIN3\/HDAC1 complex (HDA19), suggesting that SAP18 is not essential in recruiting a functional HDAC1 complex to AGL15 bound promoters. SAP18 is broadly expressed, but transcript levels increase in response to NaCl, drought and cold stress (Song and Galbraith, 2006). Therefore regulation of targets involved in the stress response, such at CBF2, are intriguing. A number of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins are likely to serve as platforms, targeting the SIN3\/HDAC1 complex to these various target genes. We propose that AGL15 functions as one of these platforms, thus recruiting SAP18 and ultimately other components of the SIN3\/HDAC complex to a subset of target genes.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"301eda63","id":"4066c471","subj":"20f5281c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7aaca91a","id":"2b175c00","subj":"71e693fa"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7ceb3185","id":"3eb81efb","subj":"2d6c53fc"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"3148f668","id":"1ae8bcbc","subj":"2d6c53fc"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"3d246ea3","id":"6cdba6dc","subj":"1d483de4"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6337c201","id":"7d3d101b","subj":"1d483de4"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6e005dc9","id":"30c8681","subj":"2d6c53fc"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"71e693fa","id":"5cdec700","subj":"2141a12"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"3561c410","id":"1f75a668","subj":"2d6c53fc"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7d286fb6","id":"5be49b60","subj":"71e693fa"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4e423aa2","id":"2931522b","subj":"2d6c53fc"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"571c5681","id":"7674b62c","subj":"488d1cd7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6d026701","id":"19e7a160","subj":"4e31276e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"55cf0d14","id":"662706a7","subj":"27adc16e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7e19ebf0","id":"45a4b042","subj":"f99f5e0"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6d026701","id":"16b2bb0c","subj":"6304101a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7c214cc0","id":"6cb6decd","subj":"2d6c53fc"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4032d386","id":"7d898981","subj":"27adc16e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"71e693fa","id":"78aa1f72","subj":"41005828"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"6853425f","id":"327af41b","subj":"5082d622"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"63eef88a","id":"6aa61224","subj":"5082d622"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5082d622","id":"b978d10","subj":"3370f42"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5082d622","id":"5c45d770","subj":"9573584"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"75d2da2d","id":"68d279ec","subj":"5082d622"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5082d622","id":"258d79be","subj":"332729ad"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"67b9b51a","id":"147a5d08","subj":"57576994"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"6d026701","id":"1b45c0e","subj":"2812b107"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"67b9b51a","id":"10f7f7de","subj":"616ac46a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"30bce90b","id":"73a8da0f","subj":"f99f5e0"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"67b9b51a","id":"50dfbc58","subj":"1205bd62"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"4278284b","id":"1672fe87","subj":"18e36d14"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"5b7a8434","id":"6bf08014","subj":"3c01cfa1"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"68f4865","id":"5965be2d","subj":"5717c37"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4416d64f","id":"3e74829","subj":"68f4865"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7b8b43c7","id":"3eb77ea8","subj":"71e693fa"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"3e6f3f28","id":"5e3d57c7","subj":"c7045b9"},{"pred":"Is_Linked_To","obj":"55cf0d14","id":"21129f1f","subj":"4032d386"},{"pred":"Is_Linked_To","obj":"3d246ea3","id":"5a9f4771","subj":"28d18df5"},{"pred":"Is_Linked_To","obj":"6337c201","id":"282cb7c7","subj":"28d18df5"},{"pred":"Is_Linked_To","obj":"68dc098b","id":"48d61b48","subj":"488d1cd7"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"5026735c","id":"14f9390f","subj":"11f0a5a1"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"38ba6ce3","id":"6c0d7c83","subj":"25f4878b"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"5026735c","id":"176b75f7","subj":"1bae316d"},{"pred":"Composes_Protein_Complex","obj":"4278284b","id":"409c54f","subj":"418c5a9c"},{"pred":"Is_Involved_In_Process","obj":"6fa34d52","id":"3b8f0a79","subj":"1fd14d74"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"45d2ade3","id":"48793bef","subj":"3c01cfa1"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-19594710-1","denotations":[{"obj":"Pathway","id":"3f67593e","span":{"end":1515,"begin":1501}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"4241e0f4","span":{"end":138,"begin":122}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"345f69f3","span":{"end":307,"begin":282}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"12359a82","span":{"end":1212,"begin":1178}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"68df9280","span":{"end":1182,"begin":1165}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"30c93896","span":{"end":1384,"begin":1363}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"59a008ba","span":{"end":1461,"begin":1449}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"21ba0741","span":{"end":1515,"begin":1488}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"6c2ed0cd","span":{"end":20,"begin":12}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"f107c50","span":{"end":25,"begin":22}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"51133c06","span":{"end":63,"begin":54}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4b213651","span":{"end":69,"begin":65}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"3f57bcad","span":{"end":369,"begin":354}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"51549490","span":{"end":403,"begin":381}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"73d983ea","span":{"end":433,"begin":413}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"36a5cabc","span":{"end":484,"begin":446}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"36060e","span":{"end":604,"begin":601}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"65b104b9","span":{"end":779,"begin":775}},{"obj":"Protein"

an APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factor, WRINKLED1 (WRI1), has been shown to be required for accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) in Arabidopsis seeds, its direct target genes have not been established. Overexpression of WRI1 up-regulated a set of genes involved in fatty acid (FA) synthesis in plastids, including genes for a subunit of pyruvate kinase (Pl-PKβ1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (BCCP2), acyl carrier protein (ACP1), and ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS1), while expression of these genes is reduced in mutants with reduced WRI1 expression. Transient expression of LUC reporter genes with the proximal sequences upstream from the ATG codon of Pl-PKβ1, BCCP2, and KAS1 in protoplasts was activated by co-expression of WRI1, and recombinant WRI1 bound to these upstream sequences in vitro. The seven WRI1 binding sites shared a sequence [CnTnG](n)7[CG], where n is any nucleotide designated as the AW-box, and mutations in AW-boxes near the transcription start site and in the 5\u2032-untranslated region of Pl-PKβ1 abolished activation by WRI1 in protoplasts and expression during seed maturation. Although expression of genes for the synthesis of TAGs and packaging into oil bodies in the endoplasmic reticulum in developing seeds required WRI1, their expression was not up-regulated by WRI1 overexpression.

major storage lipids in oil-accumulating seeds such as Arabidopsis thaliana are triacylglycerols (TAGs), esters of glycerol and fatty acids (FAs). During seed development, incoming sucrose is cleaved to hexoses by cell wall-bound invertase (cwINV) and transported into cells, or sucrose transported into the cell is cleaved into UDP-glucose and fructose by sucrose synthase (SUS) in the cytoplasm. De novo synthesis of FAs occurs in the plastid, which imports intermediates of sugar metabolism such as glucose 6-phosphate (Glu6P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from the cytoplasm; the metabolic pathway for the synthesis of FAs in plants has been extensively studied (Ohlrogge and Browse, 1995; Rawsthorne, 2002; Nishida, 2005). The C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 FAs synthesized in plastids (Nishida, 2005) are further elongated and\/or desaturated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the assembly of TAGs occurs through stepwise acylation of a glycerol backbone (Ohlrogge and Browse, 1995). The final step of TAG assembly is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (TAG1\/DGAT1; Routaboul et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1999), and TAGs are finally coated with oleosins to form oil bodies (Huang, 1996).\nIn Arabidopsis, developing seeds first accumulate starch, which is later degraded, and oil accumulation occurs with the accumulation of seed storage proteins during the late maturation phase (Baud et al., 2002; Ruuska et al., 2002; Hills, 2004). LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC2, FUSCA3 (FUS3), and ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), function as the master regulators of embryogenesis and seed maturation (Parcy et al., 1997; Lotan et al., 1998; To et al., 2006). Mutants of these LEC-type transcription factors show defective seed maturation with reduced accumulation of seed storage proteins and TAGs, while their ectopic expression in early vegetative seedlings causes the synthesis of seed storage compounds (Kagaya et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2005; Braybrook et al., 2006).\nSeeds of the wrinkled1 (wri1) mutant show 80% reduction in TAGs compared with the wild type and accumulate sucrose (Focks and Benning, 1998). WRI1 is an APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factor with two AP2 DNA-binding domains (Cernac and Benning, 2004). The ACTIVATOR of SPOmin:LUC1 (ASML1) identified from an enhancer activation-tagged mutant that overexpresses a sugar-inducible luciferase (LUC) reporter gene was identical with WRI1 (Masaki et al., 2005). Expression of WRI1 occurs during seed development (Cernac and Benning, 2004; Masaki et al., 2005), and expression of genes involved in glycolysis and lipid synthesis in developing seeds is compromised in wri1 mutants (Ruuska et al., 2002). WRI1 functions downstream of LEC1 and LEC2, and ectopic expression of LEC1, LEC2, or WRI1 in vegetative tissues up-regulates the expression of genes involved in FA synthesis (Baud et al., 2007; Mu et al., 2008). To understand the role of WRI1 in the regulation of seed oil accumulation and in seed maturation and germination it is important to identify direct targets of WRI1 and its binding site sequences. Although DNA binding of one of the AP2-type transcription factors, AINEGMENTA (ANT; Elliott et al., 1996; Klucher et al., 1996), has been characterized (Nole-Wilson and Krizek, 2000; Krizek, 2003), direct target genes of ANT and other AP2-type transcription factors have not been identified so far.\nIn the present study we show that many genes involved in various steps of FA synthesis in plastids are the direct targets of WRI1 during seed maturation. The proximal upstream regions of these genes contain a conserved sequence, designated as the AW-box, to which WRI1 binds.

involved in the de novo synthesis of FA in plastids formed the largest group of metabolic genes up-regulated by WRI1 overexpression. Proteins encoded by these genes participate in various steps of the uptake of glycolytic intermediates into plastids, conversion to acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, and the synthesis of FAs from them. In addition, genes involved in the synthesis of lipoic acid, a cofactor of PDH, are also activated in both Enh-WRI1 and 35S-WRI1 plants. Similar results were reported by Baud et al. (2007). Consistent with the expression levels of WRI1 mRNA (Figure 1b), enhanced expression of genes involved in FA synthesis was more prominent in Enh-WRI1 compared with 35S-WRI1 (Figure 2a). On the other hand, mRNA levels of genes involved in FA synthesis were reduced in wri1-10.\nExpression of the LUC reporter genes with the proximal upstream regions of Pl-PKβ1, BCCP2, ACP1, and KAS1 in protoplasts was transactivated by co-expression of WRI1 (Figure 3a), and recombinant WRI1 showed specific binding to the unique sequence (AW-box) within the upstream regions (Figure 4). Mutations in two AW-boxes in the upstream region of Pl-PKβ1 abolished the WRI1-binding in vitro, transactivation by WRI1 in protoplasts, and expression during seed development (Figure 6). Altogether, these results indicate that genes involved in FA synthesis in plastids are among the direct targets of WRI1 during seed development. Expression patterns of these genes involved in FA synthesis during seed development are quite similar to that of WRI1 (Figure 3d; Baud et al., 2007; Ruuska et al.,

AW-box in the 5\u2032-UTR functions as a cis-element for expression during seed development\nOne or two AW-box sequences were identified within the 1000-bp proximal sequence upstream of the ATG codon of 19 genes for FA synthesis in plastids (Figure 7). AW-boxes are also present in the proximal upstream regions of GPT2 (Niewiadomski et al., 2005), PPT\/CUE1 (Knappe et al., 2003), and BIO2 for biotin synthesis (Arnal et al., 2006). Direct targets of WRI1 may also include genes with sequences that are slightly different from the AW-box and genes with AW-boxes in other locations. Similar to genes encoding subunits of photosynthetic apparatus in plastids (Nakamura et al., 2002), many genes involved in FA synthesis in plastids have TATA-less promoters.\nMany AW-boxes are located near TSS and in the 5\u2032-UTR of genes involved in FA synthesis, irrespective of the presence of the TATA-element (Figure 7). Mutational analysis has indicated that both site 1 and site 2 AW-boxes of Pl-Pkβ1 are functional as cis-elements for activation by WRI1 in protoplasts and for expression during seed development (Figure 6c,d). Both of the two AW-boxes in the upstream region of BCCP2 were also involved in transactivation by WRI1. It has been reported that the transcriptional activator AtPurα of Arabidopsis binds to the telo-box that is present in the 5\u2032-UTR or near the TSS of many ribosomal protein genes, and it interacts with the TCP family transcription factor that binds to site II sequences located upstream of the telo-box (Trémousaygue et al.,

WRINKLED1 (WRI1) protein is an important regulator of oil accumulation in maturing Arabidopsis seeds. WRI1 is a member of a plant-specific family of transcription factors (AP2\/EREBP) that share either one or two copies of a DNA-binding domain called the AP2 domain. Here, it is shown that WRI1 acts as a transcriptional enhancer of genes involved in carbon metabolism in transgenic seeds overexpressing this transcription factor. PKp-β1 and BCCP2, two genes encoding enzymes of the glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, respectively, have been chosen to investigate the regulatory action exerted by WRI1 over these pathways. Using the reporter gene uidA, it was possible to demonstrate in planta that WRI1 regulates the activity of both PKp-β1 and BCCP2 promoters. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and yeast one-hybrid experiments showed that WRI1 was able to interact with the BCCP2 promoter. To further elucidate the regulatory mechanism controlling the transcription of these genes, functional dissections of PKp-β1 and BCCP2 promoters were performed. Two enhancers, of 54 and 79 bp, respectively, have thus been isolated that are essential to direct the activity of these promoters in oil-accumulating tissues of the embryo. A consensus site is present in these enhancers as well as in other putative target promoters of WRI1. Loss of this consensus sequence in the BCPP2 promoter decreases both the strength of the interaction between WRI1 and this promoter in yeast and the activity of the promoter in planta.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Is_Involved_In_Process","obj":"79d94571","id":"46944ca9","subj":"635572a7"},{"pred":"Is_Involved_In_Process","obj":"76012793","id":"63798ca7","subj":"6bbe2511"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"4ce7fffa","id":"22bac7bc","subj":"1e636ea3"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"2f40e5db","id":"4612b856","subj":"e54303"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"6d3c5255","id":"22875539","subj":"6986bbaf"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"530712d","id":"5674e1f2","subj":"e54303"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"6986bbaf","id":"2a448449","subj":"b1712f3"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"2dc995f4","id":"76884e4b","subj":"530712d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"2f40e5db","id":"126945f9","subj":"2dc995f4"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"497486b3","id":"43f82e78","subj":"6127a7e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"737a135b","id":"e8df99a","subj":"2654635"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"75f95314","id":"2eee3069","subj":"6127a7e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"737a135b","id":"2da59753","subj":"15dcfae7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"495fac5f","id":"5629510","subj":"6127a7e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"737a135b","id":"4df5bcb4","subj":"687ef2e0"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"3da05287","id":"4ff4357f","subj":"1e636ea3"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"2df6226d","id":"49cb9cb5","subj":"2a898881"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"2dc995f4","id":"55322aab","subj":"e54303"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"15dcfae7","id":"45fd9a4d","subj":"2654635"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"75f95314","id":"50468873","subj":"497486b3"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"130dca52","id":"2b4c1d96","subj":"2654635"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"687ef2e0","id":"146587a2","subj":"2654635"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"497486b3","id":"5f0e9815","subj":"495fac5f"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-21123653-2","denotations":[{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"2a76840c","span":{"end":4172,"begin":4142}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"623e088f","span":{"end":4078,"begin":4059}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"39fcbef6","span":{"end":3979,"begin":3966}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"6179e425","span":{"end":2282,"begin":2269}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"2d6764b2","span":{"end":2433,"begin":2414}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"49c6c24f","span":{"end":2459,"begin":2441}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"13d73fa","span":{"end":4302,"begin":4287}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"5023bb8b","span":{"end":4212,"begin":4183}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"2d96543c","span":{"end":2605,"begin":2592}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"7d64e326","span":{"end":2797,"begin":2779}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"13f95696","span":{"end":2847,"begin":2829}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"cd1d761","span":{"end":2812,"begin":2799}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"69653e16","span":{"end":3882,"begin":3838}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"ebaa6cb","span":{"end":3829,"begin":3803}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"f80945f","span":{"end":3164,"begin":3150}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"55dfebeb","span":{"end":3284,"begin":3265}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"1e8ce150","span":{"end":146,"begin":118}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"1d3ac898","span":{"end":146,"begin":128}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"6ad59d92","span":{"end":4410,"begin":4387}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"4535b6d5","span":{"end":3447,"begin":3434}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"4372b9b6","span":{"end":3489,"begin":3473}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"4b41e4dd","span":{"end":3607,"begin":3590}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"40844aab","span":{"end":3628,"begin":3617}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"28e8dde3","span":{"end":4658,"begin":4620}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"54dcfa5a","span":{"end":4505,"begin":4476}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"301ec38b","span":{"end":4468,"begin":4453}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"59252cb6","span":{"end":857,"begin":837}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"542e560f","span":{"end":916,"begin":890}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"4dc8caa7","span":{"end":1056,"begin":1026}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"1d730606","span":{"end":1105,"begin":1085}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"613a8ee1","span":{"end":1667,"begin":1650}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"72c28d64","span":{"end":1955,"begin":1942}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"6492fab5","span":{"end":1938,"begin":1924}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"51972dc7","span":{"end":2146,"begin":2128}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"71454b9d","span":{"end":4109,"begin":4083}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"35f26e72","span":{"end":2282,"begin":2254}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"6399551e","span":{"end":4340,"begin":4287}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"6e35bc3d","span":{"end":3257,"begin":3225}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"5d9b7a8a","span":{"end":110,"begin":63}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"30b19518"

(miRNAs) are ∼21-nucleotide (nt) RNAs that guide the post-transcriptional regulation of target genes during plant\nand animal development (Bartel 2004). Plant miRNAs recognize nearly perfect complementary binding sites in target mRNAs and mediate RNA cleavage (Llave et al. 2002; Rhoades et al. 2002; Tang et al. 2003). The high degree of complementarity between plant miRNAs and their binding sites in target mRNAs has allowed confident miRNA\ntarget predictions (Rhoades et al. 2002; Jones-Rhoades and Bartel 2004; Fahlgren and Carrington 2010). Plant miRNA targets tend to encode key developmental regulators, including many transcription factors (Rhoades et al. 2002; Jones-Rhoades et al. 2006). Accordingly, several studies have demonstrated that the miRNA-mediated repression of target transcripts is essential for\ncorrect cell differentiation and developmental timing during post-embryonic development (Jones-Rhoades et al. 2006; Chen 2009). However, relatively little is known regarding the roles of miRNAs in embryonic cell differentiation, and miRNA functions\nduring embryo developmental timing have not been characterized.\nDICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) encodes an RNaseIII domain-containing protein that is nuclear-localized and required for processing primary miRNA transcripts\ninto mature miRNAs (Park et al. 2002; Reinhart et al. 2002; Papp et al. 2003; Fang and Spector 2007). With this realization that DCL1 is necessary for miRNA biogenesis, the recovery and analysis of dcl1 mutant alleles from previous forward genetic screens performed using Arabidopsis thaliana (Schauer et al. 2002) provide insight into the roles of miRNAs during plant development. Null dcl1 alleles (originally named emb76, then sus1) were recovered by Meinke's group (Errampalli et al. 1991; Castle et al. 1993) more than 15 years ago in screens for embryos with defective development. dcl1 embryos are developmentally arrested at the globular stage of embryogenesis and exhibit abnormal divisions throughout the\nextraembryonic suspensor (Schwartz et al. 1994). These results suggest that DCL1 and, by implication, miRNAs are required for embryo development and viability. Null mutations in other genes required for\nnormal miRNA biogenesis or function also produce defects during embryogenesis (Lynn et al. 1999; Lobbes et al. 2006; Grigg et al. 2009). In addition, specific miRNA\/target interactions are required for proper cotyledon formation during embryo development (Palatnik et al. 2003; Laufs et al. 2004; Mallory et al. 2004, 2005). Moreover, several plant miRNA targets are required for proper embryogenesis (Aida et al. 1997; Emery et al. 2003; Dharmasiri et al. 2005; Prigge et al. 2005). Collectively, these results strongly indicate that miRNAs have important functions during embryo development.\nMorphogenesis is the phase of embryo development when the basic plant body plan is established. Embryonic cell types are specified\nin particular locations at precise developmental time points. Shoot meristem precursors and root meristem precursors are specified\nat the apical and basal poles of the early embryo, respectively (Mayer et al. 1991). The post-embryonic activity of these meristems generates the adult plant body. Patterning along the radial axis during\nearly embryogenesis generates the outermost protoderm layer, the innermost vascular primordium, and a middle layer of ground\ntissue precursors (Laux et al. 2004). After morphogenesis, embryos transition to a maturation phase, where they accumulate storage proteins, undergo desiccation\ntolerance, and prepare to enter into a state of dormancy prior to germination (Gutierrez et al. 2007; Holdsworth et al. 2008). Although progress has been made (Weber et al. 2005; Braybrook and Harada 2008; Park and Harada 2008), the molecular basis of early embryonic patterning and the morphogenesis-to-maturation-phase transition are not completely\nunderstood.\nTo assess the regulatory functions of miRNAs during embryogenesis, we revisited the phenotypic characterization of dcl1 embryos, with a focus on early morphogenesis and cell specification defects. DCL1 was required for multiple embryonic cell differentiation events as early as the eight-cell stage. Genome-wide transcript\nprofiling revealed that DCL1 was required for the early embryonic repression of nearly 50 miRNA targets. Several of the miRNA targets up-regulated in\neight-cell dcl1 embryos encode transcription factors that promote differentiation during later stages of embryogenesis. Moreover, dcl1 embryos prematurely accumulated transcripts from hundreds of genes typically expressed during the maturation phase of embryo\ndevelopment.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"7d64e326","id":"74c79fa2","subj":"1fdf1c5"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"4b41e4dd","id":"53bd8fca","subj":"305a0c5f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"5023bb8b","id":"5cde6747","subj":"eda25e5"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"2a76840c","id":"37091312","subj":"eda25e5"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"3ed242a4","id":"57abad67","subj":"2d96543c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"79351f41","id":"5669c5fb","subj":"2d96543c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"51972dc7","id":"5f9678e1","subj":"2c532cd8"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"6d23017e","id":"112f364d","subj":"59252cb6"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"5f6722d3","id":"31d0e481","subj":"51972dc7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5f6722d3","id":"1e0f9063","subj":"3700ec9c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"2e8e8225","id":"7642df8f","subj":"41dd05a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6d23017e","id":"3e30646a","subj":"5ccbeb64"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"77b14724","id":"63a270c9","subj":"5d9b7a8a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"62e20a76","id":"1199fe66","subj":"42721fe"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6399551e","id":"614df0a4","subj":"5d5f10b2"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"30b19518","id":"906d29b","subj":"63dd899"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6ebf0f36","id":"436bc36","subj":"2807bdeb"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6ebf0f36","id":"604c5de8","subj":"39a8312f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4372b9b6","id":"663411de","subj":"22ffa91a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4372b9b6","id":"33b1c5c5","subj":"1ecee32c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"30b19518","id":"10b9db7b","subj":"2cc44ad"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7b84fcf8","id":"9ef8eb7","subj":"5d9b7a8a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"366ac49b","id":"10ded6a9","subj":"42721fe"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5d9b7a8a","id":"c5dc4a2","subj":"1e8ce150"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6ad59d92","id":"4a194c39","subj":"30b19518"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"30b19518","id":"52066604","subj":"1b73be9f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"2807bdeb","id":"56113384","subj":"18920cc"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"39a8312f","id":"373ebf74","subj":"18920cc"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"305a0c5f","id":"c4ed84","subj":"22ffa91a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"305a0c5f","id":"189aa67a","subj":"1ecee32c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"61f05988","id":"362045c0","subj":"59f63e24"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6b3e12b5","id":"6d9f7a80","subj":"35d08e6c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"3700ec9c","id":"241e8ea6","subj":"2c532cd8"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"6e35bc3d","id":"37c7595","subj":"5b202a3a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"6e35bc3d","id":"49d3c823","subj":"34cdeda2"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"6ee660fb","id":"75cd8043","subj":"55dfebeb"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"5b202a3a","id":"17a1e4ca","subj":"55dfebeb"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"55dfebeb","id":"340b9973","subj":"34cdeda2"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"6ee660fb","id":"5a9d6f02","subj":"6e35bc3d"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"3b00856b","id":"66fdec9","subj":"35d08e6c"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"77b14724","id":"2a640157","subj":"1cdc4c27"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"6c45ee6e","id":"550a1967","subj":"5aac4250"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"6c45ee6e","id":"5d8bafa9","subj":"35d08e6c"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"63dd899","id":"628c4ac0","subj":"2cc44ad"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7b84fcf8","id":"363042d7","subj":"77b14724"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"79351f41","id":"56f0cc85","subj":"3ed242a4"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"62e20a76","id":"44b3606b","subj":"366ac49b"},{"pred":"Occurs_During","obj":"6e35bc3d","id":"59d2400d","subj":"55dfebeb"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-21123653-6","denotations":[{"obj":"RNA","id":"2dd80673","span":{"end":2357,"begin":2351}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"57ea113a","span":{"end":2496,"begin":2490}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"2072acb2","span":{"end":2622,"begin":2616}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"19648c40","span":{"end":46,"begin":40}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"65fe9e33","span":{"end":644,"begin":638}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"293a5f75","span":{"end":744,"begin":738}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"fcb4004","span":{"end":828,"begin":822}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"2dd29a59","span":{"end":930,"begin":924}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"366c4480","span":{"end":1156,"begin":1149}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"7e8dcdaa","span":{"end":1463,"begin":1457}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"681a8b4e","span":{"end":1699,"begin":1693}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"c35172e","span":{"end":1906,"begin":1900}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"3668d4","span":{"end":2088,"begin":2083}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"4af0df05","span":{"end":2350,"begin":2340}},{"obj":

found that DCL1 and, by implication, miRNAs were required for multiple embryonic patterning events beginning as early as the eight-cell stage.\nIn fact, the only cell type that appeared to differentiate correctly in dcl1 embryos was the outermost protoderm layer. Furthermore, protoderm markers that are typically restricted to the embryo proper\nwere ectopically expressed in dcl1 suspensors at the late globular and early heart stages (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. 2), which helps explain a previously reported function of DCL1\/SUS1 in maintaining the extraembryonic cell fate of the suspensor (Schwartz et al. 1994).\nThe requirement of miRNAs for proper embryonic patterning and cell differentiation might have suggested that embryonic miRNAs\nact to trigger developmental transitions, as was first reported for metazoan miRNAs (Lee et al. 1993; Wightman et al. 1993; Moss et al. 1997; Reinhart et al. 2000), where induced miRNAs act to down-regulate genes that contribute to the differentiation state of the precursor cells. Or\nthey might act to sharpen developmental transitions, as observed in fish, frog, and, perhaps, mammalian embryos, where miR-430\nor its orthologs clears maternally expressed messages to sharpen the transition from maternal to zygotic expression programs\n(Farh et al. 2005; Giraldez et al. 2006; Lund et al. 2009). Indeed, an analogous function in sharpening developmental transitions was proposed and has been observed for plant miRNAs\nat later developmental stages (Rhoades et al. 2002; Aukerman and Sakai 2003; Lauter et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2009). However, our molecular characterization of the Dcl1 phenotype shows that the earliest known developmental roles of miRNAs\nin plants is not to trigger or sharpen developmental transitions by repressing genes with developmental functions in precursor\ncell types, but instead is the opposite (Fig. 7). In eight-cell embryos, miRNAs repress genes that function in daughter cell types later in embryo development. Instead of\nattenuating pre-existing function, they prevent precocious function. Dicer and other miRNA biogenesis proteins are required\nfor formation of the mammalian mesoderm and differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (Bernstein et al. 2003; Kanellopoulou et al. 2005; O'Rourke et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2007). Perhaps as the roles of individual vertebrate miRNAs are examined in more detail, analogous functions in preventing precocious\nembryonic expression will help explain the requirement of miRNAs for mammalian embryonic development.

seed is a key evolutionary adaptation of land plants that facilitates dispersal and allows for germination when the environmental\nconditions are adequate. Mature seeds are dormant and desiccated, with accumulated storage products that are to be used by\nthe seedling after germination. These properties are imposed on the developing embryo by a maturation program, which operates\nduring the later part of embryogenesis. A number of \u201Cmaster regulators\u201D (the \u201CLEC genes\u201D) required for the induction of the\nmaturation program have been described, but it is not known what prevents this program from being expressed during early embryogenesis.\nHere, we report that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) embryos mutant for strong alleles of DICER-LIKE1, the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of microRNAs (miRNAs), mature earlier than their wild-type counterparts. This\nheterochronic phenotype indicates that miRNAs are key regulators of the timing of the maturation program. We demonstrate that\nmiRNAs operate in part by repressing the master regulators LEAFY COTYLEDON2 and FUSCA3 and identify the trihelix transcription factors ARABIDOPSIS 6B-INTERACTING PROTEIN1-LIKE1 (ASIL1) and ASIL2 and the histone deacetylase HDA6\/SIL1 as components that act downstream of miRNAs to repress the maturation program early in embryogenesis. Both ASIL1 and HDA6\/SIL1 are known to act to prevent the expression of embryonic maturation genes after germination, but to our knowledge, this is\nthe first time they have been shown to have a role during embryogenesis. Our data point to a common negative regulatory module\nof maturation during early embryogenesis and seedling development.\nOne of the reasons for the evolutionary success of seed plants is their ability to generate a resistant structure, the seed,\nwhich facilitates dispersal and reinitiates development only in the appropriate environmental conditions. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), wild-type embryos follow a predictable pattern of cell divisions, going through a series of stages named after the shape\nof the embryo: preglobular, globular, transition, heart, torpedo, bent green cotyledon, and mature (Jürgens and Mayer, 1994). These stages encompass two major phases of development. The first part of embryogenesis, until the heart stage, is devoted\nto patterning, setting up the embryonic axes, meristems, and tissue types (Jenik et al., 2007). The heart-to-late-heart stage transition marks the onset of embryonic maturation, first evidenced by the appearance of\nchlorophyll autofluorescence in the epidermis of the hypocotyl, signaling the beginning of proplastid maturation to chloroplasts\n(Mansfield and Briarty, 1991). The embryos turn green in color and start accumulating storage products at the early torpedo stage. The photosynthetic\nactivity of the embryonic chloroplasts may contribute to the biosynthesis of storage lipids (Ruuska et al., 2004). In Arabidopsis, the storage products include seed storage proteins and storage lipids (very-long-chain fatty acids, polyunsaturated\nfatty acids, and triacylglycerols; Baud et al., 2008). Once the embryos fill the seed, they acquire desiccation tolerance, desiccate, and enter dormancy (Vicente-Carbajosa and Carbonero, 2005; Baud et al., 2008).\nBecause the maturation program directs seed dormancy, it needs to be carefully timed, ensuring it starts midembryogenesis\nand is repressed after germination. A complex network is involved in timing maturation during embryo development, including\npositive regulators of maturation during midembryogenesis and negative regulators after germination. The existence of repressors\nof maturation in early embryogenesis has been postulated, but none have been identified so far (for review, see Baud et al., 2008; Santos-Mendoza et al., 2008).\nThe central positive regulators of the seed maturation program are the \u201CLEC genes\u201D (the B3 domain transcription factors LEAFY-COTYLEDON2\n[LEC2] and FUSCA3 [FUS3] and the B subunits of the NF-Y family of trimeric transcription factors LEC1 [also called NF-YB9]\nand LEC1-LIKE [L1L, NF-YB6]) and the B3 domain transcription factor ABA INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3). Single loss-of-function mutations\nin all of these genes result in deficiencies in the accumulation of storage products, desiccation intolerance, and\/or a heterochronic\nchange of cotyledons into true leaves. These factors regulate each other at the transcriptional level in embryos, and their\ninteractions vary depending on tissue type. The hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and GA interact with this network of transcription\nfactors. High ratios of ABA to GA promote maturation via ABI3 and ABI5 (Santos-Mendoza et al., 2008). In vitro studies have suggested that LEC1 and L1L interact with NY-YC1, -2, and -6 to up-regulate the induction of storage\nproduct genes by ABA (Yamamoto et al., 2009). Several lines of evidence have identified other positive regulators, acting either at the same level or downstream of the\nLEC genes, by binding to the promoters of genes encoding storage proteins and other genes involved in seed maturation: bZIP\ntranscription factors that cooperate with the NF-Y complexes (ABI5, bZIP10, bZIP25, bZIP53, and bZIP67; Bensmihen et al., 2002; Alonso et al., 2009; Yamamoto et al., 2009); MYB transcription factors (AtMYB115 and AtMYB118; Zhang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009); and MADS box transcription factors (AGAMOUS-LIKE15 [AGL15] and AGL18; Zheng et al., 2009).\nA number of factors are known to prevent the expression of embryonic traits after seed germination (for review, see Zhang and Ogas, 2009). This negative regulation involves transcriptional mechanisms via the B3 domain proteins VP1\/ABI3-LIKE or HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION\nOF SUGAR-INDUCIBLE GENE (VAL1\/HSI2) and VAL2\/HSL1 and the trihelix protein ARABIDOPSIS 6B-INTERACTING PROTEIN1-LIKE1 (ASIL1).\nEpigenetic factors also repress the maturation program in seedlings, including histone deacetylases (HDA6\/SIL1 and HDA19),\nPolycomb group proteins (SWINGER, CURLY LEAF, and MEDEA), and chromatin remodelers (BRAHMA, AtSWI3c, BSH, and PICKLE). These\ntranscriptional and epigenetic regulators appear to act both directly and indirectly (by modulating the actions of GA) to\nprevent the expression of the LEC genes and of the genes encoding storage products. It is not known whether any of these regulators\nor other factors are responsible for the repression of the maturation early in embryogenesis.\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-nucleotide single-stranded RNA molecules that act by binding complementary target mRNAs to promote\ntheir cleavage or interfere with translation (for review, see Voinnet, 2009). miRNAs are generated by cleavage of a precursor miRNA by a complex that includes the RNase III DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), the\ndouble-stranded RNA-binding protein HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), and the C2H2-zinc finger protein SERRATE (SE). The resulting\nmiRNAs are then methylated by HUA-ENHANCER1 (HEN1) and incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex, which leads the\nmiRNA to its target and effects either cleavage or repression of translation. ARGONAUTE proteins such as AGO1 and AGO10\/ZWILLE\/PINHEAD\nare central components of miRNA RNA-induced silencing complexes. Null alleles of dcl1 are embryonic lethal, but embryos mutant for other elements of the miRNA pathway have either nonoverlapping phenotypes or\nno observable phenotype (Lynn et al., 1999; Lu and Fedoroff, 2000; Chen et al., 2002; Grigg et al., 2005; Ronemus et al., 2006; Kurihara et al.,

we report that miRNAs are key repressors of the maturation program during embryogenesis. We demonstrate that embryos\nmutant for strong dcl1 alleles are heterochronic, maturing much earlier than normal. This heterochronic phenotype requires the action of the LEC\ngenes LEC2 and FUS3 downstream of DCL1.

storage reserves accumulated during embryogenesis in higher plants are crucial\nfor plant propagation, providing carbon and energy during germination prior to seedling\nestablishment. In mature Arabidopsis seeds, storage lipids and proteins are the major\nstorage compounds, each accounting for 30% - 45% of the seed dry weight [1]. The past decade has witnessed a substantial progress in identification and characterization\nof genes involved in the de novo fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly pathways [[1,4] and references therein]. This advancement is particularly evident in the model plant\nArabidopsis, largely owing to the sequencing and release of its relatively compact\ngenome in the year 2000 [5]. Moreover, characterization of transcription factors (TFs) has led to the identification\nof several master regulator genes that play critical regulatory roles in this biological\nprocess, including ABI3 (ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3), LEC1 (LEAFY COTYLEDON 1), LEC2 and FUS3 (FUSCA 3) [6-17]. These TFs interact with each other and form complex regulatory networks [18-23], regulating multiple aspects of seed development including storage reserve accumulation\nthrough interaction with cognate cis-acting DNA elements in the promoter regions of target genes. ABI3, FUS3 and LEC2\ncontain a plant-specific 'B3' DNA-binding domain which targets RY-repeat regulatory\nelements, whereas LEC1 and L1L (LEC1-LIKE) contain a NF-YB domain binding to the CCAAT\nboxes in the promoter region [24,25]. Additional TFs such as WRINKLED 1 (WRI1), a member of plant-specific APETALA 2 (AP2)\n- ethylene response element binding factor (EREB) family, is also known to control\ntranscription of many FA biosynthetic genes [26], and recent studies show it acts via binding to the AW-box motif present in the promoter\nregion of 19 FA biosynthetic genes [27]. Moreover, ABI4 (an AP2 family protein) and various basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) TFs\nincluding ABI5 or EEL (ENHANCED EM [EMBRYO MORPHORGENESIS] LEVEL) are known regulators\nof the expression of SEED STORAGE PROTEIN (SSP) genes, which act in the same signalling network but downstream of ABI3 [28,29]. Distinct regulatory mechanisms are present in controlling the accumulation processes\nof oils and proteins, perhaps with cross-talk to coordinate the synthesis of seed\nstorage compounds. This coordination could help to explain the well-documented negative\ncorrelation (correlation coefficient ranging from -0.60 to -0.90) between oil and\nprotein content in seeds of many oleaginous species [[3] and references therein]. Moreover, several TFs, such as LEC1, ABI3 and FUS3, have\nbeen demonstrated to regulate many genes in the synthesis of both oils and storage\nproteins in developing seeds [30-32].\nIn contrast to the great advancement in characterizing individual genes involved in\nthe accumulation of seed storage reserves, the relationship of their expression and\nregulation is not well understood.

the entire coexpression network is useful for network topology analysis, isolation\nof a subnetwork (or cluster) makes it more accessible to biologists [40,58]. More importantly, a subnetwork in the large coexpression network is often more biologically\nrelevant in a pathway context. Hence, we extracted subnetworks from this gene coexpression\nnetwork for genes relevant to the accumulation of seed storage reserves (Figure 4). Of the 48 genes known to encode enzymes involved in FA biosynthesis [17,59], we identified 44 (or ~92%) genes represented on the ATH1 array, and all of them\nwere found in one subnetwork (Figure 4A). This subnetwork cluster consists of 1854 genes (Additional File 1), which is in general agreement with an interactive correlation network generated\ngenome-wide in Arabidopsis using a heuristic clustering algorithm [41]. Such a gene list can be used to identify interactors of genes in FA synthesis in\ndeveloping seeds. Consistent with the coexpression subnetwork analysis, the majority\nof genes involved in FA biosynthesis were associated with Cluster 1 (Figure 3). Their expression levels increased steadily from the globular embryo stage, generally\nreached the peak at the expanded cotyledon stage, and dramatically declined subsequently\nthroughout late seed maturation (Figure 4B). Such a unified expression pattern for most FA biosynthetic genes supports earlier\nstudies showing that FA supply can be a limiting factor for triacylglycerol (TAG)\naccumulation in developing embryos of Brassica napus [60], olive (Olea europaea L.) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.)[61], as well as cuphea lanceolata and other oil species [62]. Recent studies of metabolic flux in developing embryos of B. napus, however, indicated that TAG assembly was more limiting than FA biosynthesis in regulating\nthe flow of carbon into TAG [63]. The majority of genes encoding oilbody oleosins and SSPs were found in another subnetwork\nwith a distinct expression pattern (Figure 4C). The subnetwork encompassing genes encoding oleosins and SSPs is comprised of 1392\ngenes (Additional File 2). Genes encoding oleosins and SSPs were in Cluster 2 (Figure 3), and their expression profiles were strikingly similar. These genes were virtually\nunexpressed at the globular stage, increased rapidly (>1000-fold in many cases) from\nthe globular stage to the bilaternal stage, and remained at the elevated expression\nlevel throughout the remaining stages of seed maturation (Figure 4D). Transcripts for OLEOSIN and SSP genes are most abundant in the seed transcriptome late during seed development. In\ncontrast, most genes in the TAG assembly pathway were found in different subnetworks,\nexhibiting various expression profiles during seed development (Figure 5). DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE 1 (DGAT1), FATTY ACID DESATURASE 2 (FAD2), FATTY ACID ELONGASE 1 (FAE1) and STEAROYL DESATURASE (SAD) genes were identified in this subnetwork, albeit expressed at substantially lower\nlevels compared to genes encoding oleosins and SSPs (Additional File 3). DGAT catalyzes the acyl-CoA-dependent acylation of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol to produce TAG and CoA [64]. FAD2 catalyzes the introduction of a second double bond into acyl groups in phospholipid\nwhereas SAD catalyzes the formation of monounsaturated FA in the plastid [65]. FAE1 catalyzes the elongation oleoyl-CoA in the endoplasmic reticulum [65]. Our analysis determined that AT1G48300, which was named DGAT3, is the putative gene encoding a cytosolic DGAT in Arabidopsis. The amino acid sequence\nof AT1G48300 has a significantly high degree of similarity (expect value < 1 Ã\u0097 10-21) to the soluble DGAT in peanut (Arachis hypogaea), where the cytosolic DGAT gene in plants was first discovered [66]. Notably, DGAT3 exhibited a similar expression pattern with DGAT1, but expressed higher during late seed maturation. In earlier studies, quantification\nof DGAT activity during seed maturation in B. napus indicated that enzyme activity was maximal during the rapid phase of oil accumulation\nwith a substantial decrease in activity occurring as oil levels reached a plateau\n[67,68].

line with the conclusions of Hughes & Galau (1989), the developmental pleiotropic and stage-specific phenotype of fus3 mutants reveals a program of late embryonic and early postembryonic development consisting of subsequent, temporally arranged modular units. Accordingly, the FUS3 gene promotes the unit responsible for seed maturation following earlier steps of morphogenesis and tissue differentiation. Loss of FUS3 function can be interpreted as a tendency to shortcut the pathway. While the fus3 embryo is still contained within the silique, seed maturation is left out and the following unit, germination, becomes active prematurely. The presence of typical vegetative traits such as, for instance, an active shoot apical meristem between cotyledons carrying trichomes (Meinke et al. 1994) supports this view by morphological criteria. On the molecular level, genes encoding MYB-family transcription factors which are typically expressed during germination and later, but not during the seed ripening phase, are actively transcribed in mutant fus3 seeds (Kirik et al. 1998). Moreover, it has been shown that in the fus3 background seed-specific promoters of storage protein genes are inactive in embryonic tissues (Bäumlein et al. 1994). Therefore, in analogy to Arabidopsis genes such as APETALA 1 or LEAFY which control the identity of the shoot apical meristem during postembryonic development (Mandel & Yanofsky 1995;Weigel & Nilsson 1995), FUS3 activity is essential for the zygotic seed tissue to maintain its stage-specific identity of a maturing embryo at the expense of a default tissue identity corresponding to a vegetatively growing postembryonic plant.\nIn Arabidopsis and maize a phenotype, comparable to the Fus3\u2013 syndrome with respect to storage, germination behaviour and desiccation tolerance is caused by strong recessive mutations in the genes abscisic acid insensitive 3 (ABI3;Nambara et al. 1992 ;Nambara et al. 1994 ;Ooms et al. 1993) and viviparous 1 (VP1;McCarty et al. 1989 ;McCarty 1995). Both genes have been cloned (Giraudat et al. 1992 ;McCarty et al. 1991) and show sequence similarity on the amino acid level. This raises the question whether FUS3 in Arabidopsis is related to Vp1 and AB13 molecularly.\nThe present paper reports the isolation of the FUS3 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana by positional cloning. The salient features of the deduced FUS3 amino acid sequence reveal a region of high sequence similarity with Vp1\/ABI3-like proteins. Sequence analysis of mutant fus3 alleles predicts that even minor changes affecting this conserved region are associated with defective seed maturation.\n","sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"}]
