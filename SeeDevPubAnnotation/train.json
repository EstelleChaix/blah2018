(AGAMOUS-like 15) is a member of the MADS domain family, a large, diverse family of regulatory factors. All of the members\nof this family contain a highly conserved 55\u2013 to 60\u2013amino acid domain, known as the MADS domain, which binds DNA through contacts\nin the minor groove and interactions with the phosphate backbone (Pellegrini et al. 1995). MADS domain proteins also have more divergent regions, which contribute to structural and functional specificity. MADS\ndomain\u2013containing regulatory factors are found in all eukaryotic organisms and play pivotal roles in regulating many different\nkinds of developmental events, including mating-type specification in yeast, muscle development in Drosophila and mammals,\nand responses to the environment in humans. MADS domain factors form a particularly large and diverse group in plants. In\naddition to the MADS domain, the plant proteins have another, less highly conserved domain, the K domain, which is thought\nto serve as a protein\u2013protein interaction domain (reviewed in Riechmann and Meyerowitz 1997).\nThe MADS domain family consists of at least 36 members in Arabidopsis (Liljegren et al. 1998), including the well-known floral organ identity regulators AGAMOUS (AG), APETALA3 (AP3), and PISTILLATA; meristem identity\nregulators APETALA1 (AP1) and CAULIFLOWER; silique tissue identity regulators FRUITFULL\/AGL8, AGL1, and AGL5; and a set of\nother AGL factors of unknown function expressed in flowers. Family members that are preferentially expressed in developmental\ncontexts other than the flower have also been identified (Rounsley et al. 1995) and include such factors as ANR1, which plays a role in control of root architecture in response to nutrient availability\n(Zhang and Forde 1998), and FLOWERING LOCUS C, a recently identified repressor of flowering (Michaels and Amasino 1999). Based on its expression pattern and divergent sequence, AGL15 belongs to this latter group; however, its developmental\nrole is undefined.\nOur previous findings have led us to suggest that AGL15 is likely to play an important regulatory role at the beginning of\nthe plant life cycle. We initially isolated AGL15 as a low-abundance mRNA that preferentially accumulates in developing embryos (Heck et al. 1995); Rounsley et al. 1995 independently isolated it from a floral cDNA library. AGL15 is a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis, and thus far, genome sequencing efforts have not revealed any genes likely to represent\nrecent duplications of the AGL15 locus. The only members of the MADS domain family in Arabidopsis that are known to be expressed in embryos are AGL15 and AGL2 (Flanagan and Ma 1994). AGL15 shows strong preferential expression in embryos, whereas AGL2 is predominantly expressed in floral tissues (Heck et al. 1995). Using AGL15-specific antibodies, we have shown that AGL15 accumulates in the nuclei of young embryos, endosperm, and suspensor\ncells but only in the cytoplasm of the egg cell (Perry et al. 1996). More recently, we found that AGL15 is similarly regulated in a wide variety of embryogenic situations (Perry et al. 1999).\nAlthough AGL15 accumulates preferentially in embryos, its accumulation is clearly not restricted to the embryonic phase. AGL15 transcripts have been detected in young Arabidopsis seedlings by using in situ hybridization (Rounsley et al. 1995) and in various tissues (including flowers) in Brassica by using RNA gel blot analyses (Heck et al. 1995). These findings, plus an awareness that expression patterns have provided important insights into the developmental roles\nof MADS domain factors in past investigations, motivated us to look more closely at AGL15 expression in postembryonic phases. We combined an analysis of AGL15 promoter activity with an examination of mRNA and protein accumulation to examine both qualitative and quantitative aspects\nof AGL15 expression. Because the cellular localization of AGL15 is regulated in embryos (Perry et al. 1996 , Perry et al. 1999), we also performed immunolocalization analyses to determine whether the protein accumulated in the cytoplasm or the nuclei.\nBecause we found that AGL15 accumulates transiently in nuclei in a selected set of tissues during the vegetative and reproductive\nphases, this raises the possibility that it plays multiple roles during the plant life cycle. To investigate these roles,\nwe have examined whether altering the expression pattern of AGL15 has any effect on postembryonic development. The results were striking and unexpected. The combination of effects on the\ntransition to flowering, perianth longevity, and fruit maturation defines a new kind of developmental role for a MADS domain\nfactor.

small amounts of AGL15 protein might\naccumulate in these tissues throughout the vegetative phase, we conclude that the amounts of nuclear-localized AGL15 protein\napproach those seen in young embryos only during the earliest stages of vegetative growth in the shoot apex of Arabidopsis.\nWith the onset of the reproductive phase, AGL15 promoter activity ceases in the meristematic cells at the apex of the inflorescence. This pattern of gene regulation further\ndistinguishes AGL15 from the large group of floral MADS box genes, including AP1 (Mandel et al. 1992b) and FRUITFULL\/AGL8 (Mandel and Yanofsky 1995a ; Gu et al. 1998), which are preferentially expressed during the reproductive phase and are induced or upregulated during the transition to\nflowering (Hempel et al. 1997). In terms of regulation, AGL15 is most similar to the MADS box gene FLOWERING LOCUS C, which encodes a repressor of flowering and is also downregulated in the transition to flowering (Michaels and Amasino 1999).\nDuring the reproductive phase, AGL15 promoter activity is also associated with young immature cells. Cell maturation proceeds in the apical-to-basal direction\nin floral organs, as it does in leaves (reviewed in Telfer and Poethig 1994). In both leaves and floral organs, which are considered homologous organs (reviewed in Poethig 1997), the AGL15 promoter is initially active throughout the young organ primordia but is gradually restricted to the base of the maturing\norgans.\nGiven the patterns of AGL15 promoter activity and mRNA and protein accumulation, we conclude that AGL15 function is most likely associated with the shoot\napical meristems and with young vegetative organs during the juvenile stage of the vegetative phase, when the protein concentrations\nare highest, and with floral organs up to the point at which they are fully mature. To define more clearly any possible regulatory\nroles, we turned to an analysis of transgenic plants that express AGL15 under the control of a heterologous promoter.\nEffects of AGL15 Constitutive Expression\nWe examined the effect of constitutive expression of AGL15 by generating transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying CaMV 35S promoter and AGL15 constructs.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"63070bab","id":"37271612","subj":"2d2ffcb7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"58ea606c","id":"ed7f8b4","subj":"2d2ffcb7"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"63070bab","id":"4c309d4d","subj":"58ea606c"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"757acd7b","id":"38102d01","subj":"1dac5ef"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"186f8716","id":"37883b97","subj":"1dac5ef"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"186f8716","id":"6ab778a","subj":"45ca843"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"38e79ae3","id":"77f80c04","subj":"45ca843"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"4e3958e7","id":"5c90e579","subj":"45ca843"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"313b2ea6","id":"6f45df59","subj":"2f465398"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"63070bab","id":"424e1977","subj":"291b4bf5"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5609159b","id":"10d68fcd","subj":"313b2ea6"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"37f1104d","id":"117e949d","subj":"2f54a33d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"4e3958e7","id":"6db9f5a4","subj":"1dac5ef"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"762ef0ea","id":"5f8edcc5","subj":"2898ac89"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"58ea606c","id":"7b02881e","subj":"291b4bf5"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"38e79ae3","id":"3c0be339","subj":"1dac5ef"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"762ef0ea","id":"21b2e768","subj":"31f9b85e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"4470f8a6","id":"57250572","subj":"37f1104d"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"3e96bacf","id":"1ebd319f","subj":"2b4bac49"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"3f56875e","id":"15ca7889","subj":"2b4bac49"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"76ed1b7c","id":"7a675056","subj":"6236eb5f"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"7c1e2a9e","id":"548e6d58","subj":"76ed1b7c"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"76ed1b7c","id":"a1cdc6d","subj":"394a2528"},{"pred":"Exists_At_Stage","obj":"672872e1","id":"623a8092","subj":"32910148"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"11c9af63","id":"175b9425","subj":"1dac5ef"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"68e5eea7","id":"3098cf3b","subj":"63070bab"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"11c9af63","id":"6a03bcb1","subj":"45ca843"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"484970b0","id":"610f7aa","subj":"2b4bac49"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-11489176-1","denotations":[{"obj":"Protein","id":"3c947bc5","span":{"end":615,"begin":611}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"55f616cf","span":{"end":572,"begin":568}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"46fa7c39","span":{"end":944,"begin":940}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4ef37659","span":{"end":346,"begin":342}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"776b83cc","span":{"end":401,"begin":397}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"37858383","span":{"end":355,"begin":351}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4e268090","span":{"end":444,"begin":440}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"306cf3ea","span":{"end":551,"begin":547}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5136d012","span":{"end":555,"begin":552}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"c03cf28","span":{"end":846,"begin":842}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"1fb700ee","span":{"end":915,"begin":910}},{"obj":"Environmental_Factor","id":"6497b078","span":{"end":827,"begin":811}},{"obj":"Environmental_Factor","id":"f381794","span":{"end":218,"begin":202}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"41c2284a","span":{"end":924,"begin":910}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"53aad5d5","span":{"end":900,"begin":882}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"4f67eb2a","span":{"end":74,"begin":54}},{"obj":"Gene_Family","id":"4a668b6e","span":{"end":100,"begin":75}},{"obj":"Gene_Family","id":"78ffe6dc","span":{"end":105,"begin":102}},{"obj":"Gene_Family","id":"5939a379","span":{"end":551,"begin":547}},{"obj":"Hormone","id":"5f683daf","span":{"end":88,"begin":75}},{"obj":"Hormone","id":"6f27a732","span":{"end":157,"begin":154}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"8317c52","span":{"end":183,"begin":133}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"68e965f5","span":{"end":183,"begin":154}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"76f2bbc1","span":{"end":137,"begin":133}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"1bb266b3","span":{"end":436,"begin":427}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"e1de817","span":{"end":580,"begin":568}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"2beee7ff","span":{"end":562,"begin":547}}],"text":"Genetic and physiological studies have shown that the Arabidopsis thaliana abscisic acid-insensitive (ABI) loci interact to regulate seed-specific and\/or ABA-inducible gene expression. We have used the yeast two-hybrid assay to determine whether any of these genetic interactions reflect direct physical interactions. By this criterion, only ABI3 and ABI5 physically interact with each other, and ABI5 can form homodimers. The B1 domain of ABI3 is essential for this interaction; this is the first specific function ascribed to this domain of the ABI3\/VP1 family. The ABI5 domains required for interaction with ABI3 include two conserved charged domains in the amino-terminal half of the protein.

ABA insensitive (ABI) loci of Arabidopsis have been shown to interact genetically in regulating processes such as germination and ABA-inducible gene expression. To determine whether ABI4 or ABI5 can physically interact with themselves or any of the other ABIs, we tested pairwise combinations in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. The assay system was comprised of fusions between the ABI proteins and either the DNA-binding domain or the transcription-activation domain of GAL4. Direct interaction of the ABI protein fusions would bring the GAL4 domains of the fusions into close enough proximity to transactivate a β-galactosidase gene controlled by a GAL4-responsive promoter (James et al., 1996).\nThe GAL4-binding domain (BD)-ABI4 construct encoded a slightly truncated form of ABI4 (amino acids 3\u2013287) because a full-length ABI4 fusion provides very strong transcription-activation function in the absence of any activation domain (AD) fusion (Söderman et al., 2000). Although the truncation reduces target gene expression roughly threefold, the remaining basal level of expression is still approximately tenfold higher than that produced by the GAL4-BD alone (Figure 1a). The BD-ABI5 construct encoded all but the first eight amino acids of ABI5, thus including all conserved domains, but produced a much lower basal expression of the reporter genes (only fourfold that produced by the vector control) (Figure 1b). Combination of these GAL4-BD fusions with GAL4-AD fusions to full-length ABIs produced a broad range of results (Figure 1). ABI1 and ABI4 did not interact with either ABI4 or ABI5, but both ABI3 and ABI5 strongly interacted with ABI5.\nFigure 1.

Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON2\n(LEC2) gene is a central embryonic regulator that serves\ncritical roles both early and late during embryo development.\nLEC2 is required for the maintenance of suspensor\nmorphology, specification of cotyledon identity, progression through\nthe maturation phase, and suppression of premature germination. We\ncloned the LEC2 gene on the basis of its chromosomal\nposition and showed that the predicted polypeptide contains a B3\ndomain, a DNA-binding motif unique to plants that is characteristic of\nseveral transcription factors. We showed that LEC2 RNA\naccumulates primarily during seed development, consistent with our\nfinding that LEC2 shares greatest similarity with the B3 domain\ntranscription factors that act primarily in developing seeds,\nVIVIPAROUS1\/ABA INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3. Ectopic, postembryonic\nexpression of LEC2 in transgenic plants induces the\nformation of somatic embryos and other organ-like structures and often\nconfers embryonic characteristics to seedlings. Together, these results\nsuggest that LEC2 is a transcriptional regulator that establishes a\ncellular environment sufficient to initiate embryo development.\nEmbryogenesis in flowering\nplants begins with the double fertilization event in which the zygote\nand endosperm are formed after fusion of sperm cells with the egg cell\nand central cell of the female gametophyte, respectively. The endosperm\ninitially undergoes syncytial development with formation of\nnuclear-cytoplasmic domains, but later cellularizes (1). The developing\nembryo is nourished by the endosperm and, in many plants, only the\nperipheral layer of the endosperm remains in the mature seed.\nDevelopment of the zygote into the mature embryo can be divided\nconceptually into two distinct phases. During the early morphogenesis\nphase, the basic body plan of the plant is established with expression\nof polarity as a shoot\u2013root axis, specification of morphological\ndomains within the embryo, and formation of embryonic tissue and organ\nsystems (2\u20134). The morphogenesis phase is followed by a period of\nmaturation in which processes critical for seed formation occur (5, 6).\nDuring this late phase, reserves such as storage proteins and lipids\nare synthesized at high rates and accumulate in the seed. It is also\nduring the maturation phase that the embryo acquires the ability to\nwithstand desiccation at the final stage of seed development. At the\nend of embryogenesis, the seed consists of a mature, desiccated embryo\nthat is quiescent metabolically. Although many aspects of embryogenesis\nhave been characterized extensively, little is known at a mechanistic\nlevel of the processes that initiate embryo development.\nThe Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC) genes,\nLEC1, LEC2, and FUSCA3 (FUS3), play\nkey roles in controlling embryo development (7). Unlike most other\nembryonic regulators that function during specific stages of\nembryogenesis (8\u201311), LEC genes are unique in that they are\nrequired for normal development during both the morphogenesis and\nmaturation phases. Early in embryogenesis, LEC genes are\nrequired to specify suspensor cell fate and cotyledon identity\n(12\u201316). Late in embryogenesis, LEC genes are needed during\nthe maturation phase for the acquisition of desiccation tolerance and\nthe expression of many maturation-specific genes (13\u201317). Consistent\nwith the finding that conditions that promote maturation suppress\ngermination (6), lec mutant embryos prematurely activate the\npostgermination program (13, 15, 16, 18). Thus, LEC genes\nplay a central role in controlling many aspects of embryogenesis, and\nthey are candidates as regulators that coordinate the morphogenesis and\nmaturation phases.\nIdentification and analysis of two LEC genes confirmed their\nregulatory role in embryogenesis and provided insight into their\nfunctions. LEC1 shares extensive sequence similarity with the HAP3\nsubunit of CCAAT-binding transcription factor, implicating LEC1 as a\ntranscriptional regulator (12). Ectopic expression of LEC1\nconfers embryonic characteristics to seedlings and results in the\nformation of embryo-like structures on the surfaces of leaves,\nsuggesting that the gene plays a role in conferring embryogenic\ncompetence to cells (12). Thus, we hypothesized that LEC1 establishes a\ncellular environment that promotes embryo development and that this\nenvironment coordinates the morphogenesis and maturation phases.\nFUS3 also encodes a regulatory protein: a B3 domain\ntranscription factor that accumulates primarily during seed development\n(19). Transient assays showed that FUS3 is sufficient to activate genes\nusually expressed during maturation (20). Thus, two LEC\ngenes seem to be involved in controlling embryo development by\nregulating transcription of other genes.\nIn this article, we focus on the LEC2 gene to determine its\nrole in embryo development. Because genetic studies suggest that\nLEC1 and LEC2 may have partially redundant\nfunctions (12, 15), it is possible that LEC2 also functions in the\ninitiation and coordination of embryo development. We cloned the\nLEC2 gene and showed that it is expressed preferentially\nduring embryogenesis and encodes a protein with similarity to other\nseed-specific transcription factors.

Possesses a B3 Domain Characteristic of Transcription Factors.\nOur findings that the LEC2 gene encodes a B3 domain protein\n(Fig. 3) and is expressed primarily during embryogenesis (Fig. 4)\nsuggest that it, like LEC1 and FUS3, is a transcriptional regulator of\nseed development. The B3 domain is an ≈120-amino acid residue region\ndefined originally as the third basic region of maize VP1, which shares\nthe largest contiguous block of sequence identity with its ortholog,\nArabidopsis ABI3 (10). Subsequently, this domain was\nidentified in other plant proteins, such as AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR1 (34)\nand RELATED TO ABI3\/VP1 (32). Many proteins containing B3 domains,\nincluding ABI3\/VP1, FUS3, and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR1, function as\ntranscription factors (20, 33, 34). The B3 domain is responsible, at\nleast in part, for the DNA-binding activity of ABI3\/VP1 and RELATED\nTO ABI3\/VP1 (32, 37, 38). To our knowledge, the B3 DNA-binding domain\nis unique to plants.\nMaximum parsimony analysis (39) of the B3 domains of 48 predicted\nArabidopsis proteins suggests that LEC2, FUS3, and ABI3\nconstitute one class, perhaps indicating their common origin (S.L.S.\nand J.J.H., unpublished results). All three genes are expressed\nprimarily during embryogenesis and are required genetically for the\ncompletion of normal seed development. Although they all play roles in\nseed development, their specific functions have diverged. ABI3 is a\ntranscription factor that operates primarily during the maturation\nphase, whereas LEC2 and FUS3 are LEAFY COTYLEDON proteins required for\nprocesses during both the morphogenesis and

of LEC2 in Seed Development.\nTwo consequences of expressing the LEC2 gene\npostembryonically provide insight into its role in embryo development\nand strongly support the conclusion that LEC2 is a key regulator of\nembryogenesis. First, although seedlings expressing the\n35S∷LEC2 gene exhibited a range of\nmorphologies (Fig. 5), approximately one-third possessed embryonic\nrather than postgerminative characteristics. Cotyledons of these\nseedlings remained fleshy and did not expand, and their roots and\nhypocotyls did not extend, suggesting that ectopic LEC2\nexpression can extend embryonic development.\n35S∷LEC2 seedlings at the other end of the\nphenotypic spectrum initially resembled wild type. The reason for this\nrange of phenotypes is not clear, but one possibility is that it\nrelates to differences in transgene expression levels. Second,\nregardless of their initial morphology,\n35S∷LEC2 seedlings gave rise to somatic\nembryos as indicated by their morphological similarities with zygotic\nembryos, their expression of embryo-specific genes, and their\nestablishment of functional apical meristems (Figs. 5 and 6). Together,\nthese results suggest that ectopic LEC2 expression is\nsufficient to establish an embryonic environment that promotes somatic\nembryo formation. In this regard, it is possible that LEC2\nRNA accumulation is regulated posttranscriptionally, thereby accounting\nfor the ability of somatic embryos to \u201Cgerminate\u201D and, in some\ncases, give rise to masses of vegetatively growing plantlets.\nTransgenic seedlings ectopically expressing a different LEC\ngene, LEC1, have embryonic characteristics that are\nsubstantially similar to those of 35S∷LEC2\nembryo-like seedlings (12). Moreover, postembryonic expression of\nLEC1 is sufficient to induce somatic embryogenesis in\ntransgenic plants as occurs with 35S∷LEC2\nseedlings, although somatic embryo formation is more robust with\nLEC2. Recessive mutations in the Arabidopsis\nPICKLE (PKL) gene also induce somatic embryogenesis in\npostgerminative roots cultured on hormone-free medium (40). However,\nLEC1 is expressed in the roots of pkl mutant but\nnot wild-type seedlings (41). This result suggests that the\nchromodomain protein PKL acts normally to repress LEC1 in\npostgerminative roots, and therefore that LEC1, at least in part,\nmediates somatic embryo formation in pkl mutants. Given our\nresults, we hypothesize that LEC2 may also be derepressed in\npkl mutants.\nThe ability of LEC2 and LEC1 to induce somatic\nembryogenesis suggests a role for the genes in the establishment of\nembryogenic competence. Somatic plant cells generally must be induced\nto become competent for somatic embryogenesis (42\u201344). Embryogenic\ncompetence is often induced by culturing cells with the hormone auxin\nand, sometimes cytokinin, although completion of somatic embryogenesis\nusually requires removal of the hormone(s). LEC2 and LEC1 obviate the\nneed for hormone treatments in the acquisition of embryogenic\ncompetence, suggesting the two LEC transcription factors activate genes\nthat play roles in the initiation of somatic embryogenesis. Our finding\nthat both LEC2 and LEC1 RNAs are detected at the\nearliest embryonic stages tested (Fig. 4; ref. 12) opens the\npossibility that both genes are involved in establishing embryogenic\ncompetence during zygotic embryogenesis. Thus, the role of LEC2 and\nLEC1 in somatic embryogenesis may reflect their function in zygotic\nembryogenesis. Similarities in the expression patterns and\noverexpression phenotypes of LEC2 and LEC1\nsuggest that they may have partially overlapping roles early in zygotic\nembryogenesis to induce embryo formation. This interpretation is\nconsistent with analyses showing that lec1 lec2 double\nmutants arrest at an earlier embryonic stage than either single mutant,\nwhich indicates partial genetic redundancy (12, 15).\nAlthough LEC1 and LEC2 are each sufficient to\ninduce embryogenic competence in somatic cells, they have similar but\nnot identical functions. Mutations in each gene result in distinct\nphenotypes, and the double mutant displays a synergistic phenotype (12,\n15, 16). Furthermore, the vast majority of\n35S∷LEC1 seedlings arrest as embryo-like\nseedlings and fail to develop further, although cotyledon-like organs\nsometimes form in place of the first true leaves (12). By contrast,\n35S∷LEC2 embryo-like seedlings continued to\nproliferate, producing callus, cotyledon-like and leaf-like organs in\naddition to somatic embryos.

production of mucilage in the epidermal cells of the Arabidopsis seed coat is part of a coordinated developmental process\nthat begins with cell growth, followed by biosynthesis and polar secretion of large quantities of pectin, formation of a cytoplasmic\ncolumn through cytoplasmic constriction and vacuolar contraction, and, finally, the synthesis of a secondary cell wall (columella;\nBeeckman et al., 2000; Western et al., 2000; Windsor et al., 2000). Seed coat mucilage is dispensable under laboratory conditions in Arabidopsis and mum (mucilage-modified) mutants affecting mucilage production can be identified by a simple screening method (Western et al., 2001). Mutations in one of these genes, MUM4, yield a phenotype where mucilage is not released from hydrated mature seeds.\nSeveral genes encoding putative transcription factors have been implicated in seed coat epidermal development because mutations\nin these genes result in seeds that fail to release mucilage upon hydration. Mutants in AP2 (APETALA2), in addition to their defects in floral morphogenesis, lack differentiation past the growth phase of mucilage secretory\ncells (Jofuku et al., 1994; Western et al., 2001). TTG1 (TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1), TTG2, and GL2 (GLABRA2), which were originally identified through their role in trichome specification, have defects in both mucilage and columella\nproduction in the seed coat (Koornneef, 1981; Penfield et al., 2001; Western et al., 2001; Johnson et al., 2002). It has been shown at the genetic and molecular levels in trichomes and root hairs that TTG1 interacts with a basic helix-loop-helix\n(bHLH) protein and a tissue-specific MYB protein to activate both GL2 and TTG2 (Payne et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2002; Schiefelbein, 2003). Recently, mutations in MYB61 have been found to specifically affect both mucilage and columella production in the Arabidopsis seed coat (Penfield et al., 2001).\nThe objective of this study was to characterize the role of MUM4 in the development of the Arabidopsis seed coat. Using positional cloning of MUM4, we demonstrate that MUM4 encodes a putative NDP-l-Rha synthase. Mutations in this gene lead to reduced mucilage in the seed coat and an altered columella. Expression studies\nshow that MUM4 is developmentally regulated during seed coat differentiation such that its transcript levels are increased at the time of\nmucilage production. Furthermore, MUM4 appears to be a downstream target of a cascade of transcription factors that includes AP2, TTG1, and GL2. These results demonstrate\nthe importance of mucilage production for the morphology of seed coat epidermal cells and suggest a regulatory framework for\nthe control of seed coat epidermal

data support the hypothesis that MUM4 encodes an enzyme involved in RGI biosynthesis. First, analysis of mum4 mucilage using antibodies and gas chromatography have demonstrated a significant reduction in RGI and its composite backbone\nmonosaccharides Rha and GalUA in comparison with wild-type seeds. Second, cloning of MUM4 revealed a putative protein containing similarity to bacterial nucleotide sugar interconversion enzymes, suggesting that\nit, too, is required for the production of activated sugars. The N-terminal portion of MUM4 is most similar to bacterial dTDP-d-Glc 4,6-dehydratases, the first of three enzymes required for the conversion of dTDP-d-Glc to dTDP-l-Rha (Tonetti et al., 1998). These data favor a role for MUM4 in the synthesis of NDP-l-Rha, a key step in the production of RGI. A reverse genetics approach taken by another group has come to a similar conclusion\nregarding the putative enzymatic function of MUM4 (also designated RHM2 [RHAMNOSE BIOSYNTHESIS 2]; B. Usadel et al., 2004). However, another role in RGI biosynthesis cannot be ruled out without evidence of enzymatic activity in the conversion\nof NDP-d-Glc to NDP-l-Rha.\nGram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli encode three separate enzymes (4,6-dehydratase, 3,5-epimerase, and 4-reductase) to convert dTDP-d-Glc to dTDP-l-Rha (Tonetti et al., 1998). The putative MUM4 protein not only contains an N-terminal domain with similarity to the bacterial dTDP-d-Glc 4,6-dehydratases but also a C-terminal domain with some similarity to 4-reductases (this study; Reiter and Vanzin, 2001). There is a precedent in Arabidopsis for a bifunctional 3,5 epimerase, 4-reductase in the synthesis of GDP-l-Fuc from GDP-d-Man (GER1, GER2) (Bonin and Reiter, 2000). Therefore, based on sequence analysis, it is attractive to postulate a single, multifunctional protein acting in the conversion\nof NDP-d-Glc to NDP-l-Rha in Arabidopsis (Reiter and Vanzin, 2001).\nMUM4 is a member of a small gene family consisting of three genes (RHM1, MUM4\/RHM2, and RHM3; Reiter and Vanzin, 2001) that exhibit high identity at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. The ubiquitous expression of RHM1 and RHM3 can be postulated to provide a mechanism for the formation of the normal primary cell wall in mum4 mutants and the residual mucilage present in mum4 seed coats. Redundancy in genes coding for putative NDP-l-Rha synthases is unsurprising because of the importance of the Rha-containing pectins RGI and RGII in primary cell walls.\nIn fact, the presence of multiple genes coding enzymes involved in nucleotide sugar interconversions is common in plants (Reiter and Vanzin,

Activity Controls Seed Mass.\nAP2 was identified originally as a homeotic gene required for the specification of floral organ identity and was shown to encode\nan AP2\/EREBP transcription factor (24, 25). Here, we show that loss-of-function ap2 mutants produce large seeds. Our studies using an allelic series of mutants provide strong support that AP2 functions directly in controlling seed mass (Table 2). A recent study provided additional support for this conclusion by showing that transgene suppression of AP2 activity in Arabidopsis produced defective flowers and large seeds (40). Thus, the extent of AP2 gene activity, based on its well defined role in flower development, plays a role in determining seed mass.\nap2 mutations negatively affect plant fertility, primarily through disruption of flower structure that limits the efficiency\nof self-pollination in mutant plants. Given that limited availability of resources in the maternal plant appears to account\nfor the negative correlation between seed number and seed mass (4), ap2 mutants are expected to produce seeds larger than wild-type plants with normal fertility. We confirmed that reduced fertility\ndid affect seed mass and could account for ≈33% of the increase in average seed weight observed in a strong ap2 mutant (Table 3). However, the remaining, much larger effect of AP2 on seed mass must be attributed to factors unrelated to fertility. The early flowering of plants with strong ap2 mutant alleles (Table 1) provides additional support for the conclusion that the effects of the ap2 mutation on seed mass is not solely due to its effects on fertility. Leaf number is closely related to the availability of\nreproductive resources in the maternal plant (13). ap2 mutants produced fewer leaves than wild type and, presumably, have fewer resources available. Yet, ap2 mutants gave rise to significantly larger seeds.\nMaternal Effect of AP2 on Seed Mass. Experiments in which wildtype and ap2 mutant genotypes were crossed reciprocally (Table 3) provided an important clue about the mechanisms controlling seed mass by showing that AP2 acts through the maternal genome. Consistent with this finding are analyses of reciprocal crosses in several crop species\nshowing that seed mass is often influenced by the genotype of the maternal plant (41). One interpretation of our result is that AP2 activity in maternal tissues, potentially including the seed coat, is more important than its activity in the embryo and\nendosperm in controlling seed mass. Alternatively, because the maternal plant contributes two genome equivalents to the triploid\nendosperm, seed mass may be affected by AP2 gene dosage in the endosperm. A QTL analysis of small- and large-seeded Arabidopsis ecotypes suggests that maternal tissues are important in determining seed mass (13). A number of QTL affecting seed mass colocalized with QTL for maternal traits such as seed number, fruit size, and plant\nresources, suggesting that they operate through maternal tissues. The gene identities of these QTL have not been determined,\nalthough AP2 does appear to colocalize to a QTL affecting seed mass at the bottom of chromosome IV (13). Conversely, a recent study used genetic experiments to conclude that AP2 acts through both the endosperm and maternal tissues to affect seed size (40).\nThe endosperm has been implicated to serve as the site of parent-of-origin effects on seed mass through the imprinting of\ngenes thought to be involved in enhancing or suppressing endosperm size and, therefore, seed and embryo mass (21\u201323). Although little is known of the mechanisms mediating parent-of-origin effects on seed mass, no current evidence points\nto an involvement of AP2. For example, mutations in three genes, MEA, FIE, and FIS2, each induce endosperm phenotypes that mimic paternal genomic excess (39, 42\u201344). However, these mutations are inherited differently than AP2 is in that ap2 is a maternal sporophytic mutation, whereas mea, fie, and fis2, are female gametophytic mutations. Thus, AP2 does not act equivalently with these other genes, although they could participate in a common pathway. Two other genes, IKU1 and IKU2, have been proposed to mediate the effects of maternal and paternal dosage on seed size, because mutations in either gene\naffect many aspects of endosperm development (45). However, unlike AP2, both iku mutations are sporophytic recessive and not maternal-effect mutations. Thus, the IKU genes are also likely to operate differently than does AP2.\nHow does AP2 act maternally to control seed mass? Our experiments suggest that AP2 acts, in part, through its effects on both embryo cell number and size (Fig. 2 and Table 4). Others have shown that changes in cell number and size underlie ecotype variations in Arabidopsis seed size (13). Similar to our findings, this study of natural variation concluded that cell number differences are controlled by maternal\nfactors. However, by contrast to our results with AP2, ecotype differences in cell size were attributed to nonmaternal allelic variation. Our finding that AP2 acts maternally to affect embryo cell size may indicate that it operates through a mechanism that was not uncovered by studies\nof natural ecotype variations.\nThe seed coat has been implicated to influence seed mass. For example, sporophytic mutations in cereals that affect development\nof a specialized seed coat tissue responsible for nutrient transfer to the endosperm cause defects in seed development and\nsize (46\u201348). ap2 mutants have defective seed coats in that they lack epidermal plateaus and mucilage, their outer integument cells are larger\nthan those of wild type and are irregular in shape, and mutant seeds are hypersensitive to bleach (24, 49). Although it is not clear whether these defects are directly associated with AP2 effects on seed mass, they emphasize that the maternal component of the seed is defective in ap2 mutants.\nAP2, Seed Mass, and Soluble Sugar Metabolism. Our findings that the ap2 mutation acts maternally, potentially through the seed coat, to control seed mass (Table 3) and affects soluble sugar metabolism during seed development (Fig. 4) provide a potential explanation for the increase in embryo cell number in ap2 mutant seeds (Table 4). During seed development, modulation of hexose and sucrose levels has been implicated to control cellular activities (reviewed\nin ref. 15). Specifically, a high ratio of hexose to sucrose is correlated strongly with mitotic activity during the early morphogenesis\nphase of seed development, whereas a higher proportion of sucrose to hexose is associated with cell expansion and seed filling\nduring the late maturation phase (14\u201316). For example, immature fava bean embryos cultured with high concentrations of hexose continue to undergo cell divisions\nwhereas those cultured with high sucrose concentration enter the maturation phase (15). Thus, cell division during the morphogenesis phase and seed filling during the maturation phase appear to correlate with\nchanges in hexose and sucrose levels.\nap2 mutations induced changes in the levels of hexose and sucrose in developing seeds. These changes resulted in hexose\/sucrose\nratios that reached a higher maximal level in ap2 mutant seeds compared with wild-type seeds and that remained high for a longer period of seed development in ap2 mutants than they did in wild type (Fig. 4). For example, hexose\/sucrose ratios remained high at 9 and 11 DAP in ap2 mutants but was very low during the same period of wild-type seed development. We speculate that the altered hexose\/sucrose\nratios during ap2 mutant seed development may promote an extended period of cell division that could account for the increase in embryo cell\nnumber observed in ap2 mutants.\nAP2 is a transcription factor. Thus, it is likely to affect seed mass by regulating the expression of other genes. Given the\ndramatic changes in hexose levels in ap2 mutants, potential targets of AP2 activity are enzymes involved in sugar metabolism, such as cell-wall-bound invertases. Sucrose is transported from photosynthetic\norgans to the seed coat, a maternally derived structure, where it is metabolized differently early and late in embryogenesis\n(14, 50\u201352). During the early phase of favabean seed development, cell-wall-bound invertases localized in thin-walled parenchyma, the\ninnermost seed coat tissue, hydrolyze sucrose. Hexoses formed by the reaction move apoplastically and are transported into\nembryo cells. Cell-wall-bound invertase activity decreases during the late phase of seed development, and sucrose is transported\ndirectly into embryo cells where it is hydrolyzed by sucrose synthase. Cell-wall-bound invertase activity has been correlated\nwith seed cell number both in fava bean cultivars that exhibit variations in seed size and in the maize miniature1 mutant that is defective in the enzyme (15, 53). Thus, AP2 may affect seed mass by controlling cell-wall-bound invertase activity.\nWe note that two other members of the AP2\/EREBP transcription factor family have roles that appear to intersect with those\nof AP2. Mutations in the Arabidopsis WRINKLED1 gene lead to defects in carbohydrate metabolism and reductions in seed mass and oil content (38, 54). Arabidopsis AINTEGUMENTA gene is thought to play a role in controlling cell proliferation (55, 56). Ectopic expression of AINTEGUMENTA caused plant organs, including seeds, to increase in size in both transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco (57). The increase in seed size in transgenic plants appears to result from an increase in cell number during seed development.\nThus, other AP2\/EREBP proteins may function in a pathway similar to that of

organ formation in plants requires the maintenance of small stem cell pools in the shoot, floral, and root meristems\n(Weigel and Jürgens, 2002; Laux, 2003). Similar to animal stem cell systems, the meristems provide a microenvironment, the stem cell niche, in which differentiation\nof the resident cells is repressed, whereas daughter cells that leave this site undergo differentiation. In the Arabidopsis thaliana shoot meristem, the stem cells are located in the three outermost cell layers of the most central region of the shoot apex.\nThe stem cells cannot be distinguished by their appearance from the surrounding meristem cells, and stem cell function can\nonly be unambiguously identified by clonal studies (Stewart and Dermen, 1970). Expression of CLAVATA3 (CLV3) mRNA (Fletcher et al., 1999) that coincides with the presumed position of the apical stem cells provides an operational marker for stem cell identity\nin the shoot meristem.\nOnly a few mutants have been isolated that specifically fail to protect shoot meristem stem cells from differentiation. One\nof the genes identified from mutant studies encodes the homeodomain protein WUSCHEL (WUS). WUS is expressed in a domain underneath the stem cells termed the organizing center (OC) and is required and sufficient to maintain\nthe overlying stem cells undifferentiated (Mayer et al., 1998; Schoof et al., 2000). The stem cells in turn signal back via the CLV3 peptide to restrict the size of the OC, thereby creating a negative feedback\nloop to dynamically control the size of the stem cell population (Brand et al., 2000; Schoof et al., 2000). CLV3 presumably acts as an extracellular ligand of the CLV1 receptor kinase complex, which eventually leads to downregulation\nof WUS transcription in the recipient cells (Clark et al., 1997; Stone et al., 1998; Trotochaud et al., 1999; Rojo et al., 2002; Lenhard and Laux, 2003). In floral meristems that are homologous to indeterminate shoot meristems, the AGAMOUS (AG) gene represses WUS expression late in flower development to terminate the stem cell niche after a limited number of organs have been formed\n(Lenhard et al., 2001; Lohmann et al., 2001).\nThe primary shoot meristem is formed during embryo development (Barton and Poethig, 1993). In Arabidopsis, the onset of WUS expression in precursor cells of the OC in the 16-cell embryo suggests that shoot meristem formation has been initiated already\nat this stage (Mayer et al., 1998). CLV3 expression is detected from late heart stage on between the outgrowing cotyledons (Fletcher et al., 1999). In bent cotyledon embryos, the primary shoot meristem becomes visible as a bulge of small cytoplasmic cells that after\ngermination give rise to a rosette of leaves before an inflorescence stem is formed, carrying cauline leaves with axillary\nshoot meristems and bractless floral meristems.\nMany aspects of the mechanisms that operate in the stem cell niches to maintain stem cells undifferentiated are not understood\nand might have escaped genetic analysis due to genetic redundancy. Therefore, we performed an extensive genetic screen to\ndetect presumably rare dominant-negative mutations affecting stem cell maintenance. Here, we report the isolation and functional\ncharacterization of the semidominant l28 mutant that in the homozygous state is unable to keep stem cells undifferentiated similar to the wus mutant. We show that the premature termination of the shoot meristem in l28 mutants is caused by a mutation in the APETALA2 (AP2) gene that was previously identified as one of the components of the ABC model in floral patterning, where it represses AG (Bowman et al., 1991; Drews et al., 1991), in floral transition (Jofuku et al., 1994; Okamuro et al., 1997b), and in the control of seed size (Jofuku et

organ formation from the shoot meristem during the postembryonic life of higher plants depends on the maintenance\nof undifferentiated stem cells in specific microenvironments, named stem cell niches (Weigel and Jürgens, 2002; Laux, 2003). Here, we identify a novel regulatory pathway in shoot meristem stem cell maintenance defined by AP2 function.\nStem Cell Maintenance Is Regulated by AP2AP2 was originally identified as a floral homeotic gene encoding A-function of the ABC model of organ identity specification\n(Bowman et al., 1989, 1991). Recently, it has also been implicated in floral transition and control of seed size (Okamuro et al., 1997b; Jofuku et al., 2005; Ohto et al., 2005). Here, we show that l28 and l28\/+ plants have a number of phenotypes in common with ap2 loss-of-function alleles, such as early flowering, mispecified floral organs, and a reduction in shoot meristem size. By\ncontrast, premature termination of the shoot meristem and differentiation of the stem cells is only observed in the l28 allele. Wild-type AP2 is expressed in the shoot meristem at all stages, consistent with an as yet unknown function there. Our gene dosage experiments\nindicate that wild-type AP2 activity competes with l28 activity. A plausible interpretation of these data is that l28 acts as a dominant-negative allele of AP2 and thus identifies a novel pathway in shoot meristem development. Definite proof of this model has to await the identification\nof potential redundant factors that appear to mask AP2 function in the shoot meristem.\nThe l28 mutation changes a highly conserved negatively charged Glu residue into a positively charged Lys residue within the first\nof the two putative DNA binding domains of AP2. A possible model is therefore that the mutant protein competes with wild-type\nAP2 and redundant factor(s) for interactors in a protein complex but compromises its binding to DNA targets. Alternatively,\nthe mutant protein may still be able to bind to AP2 target genes but fail to interact with cofactors required for transcriptional\nregulation. Stochastic variations in the balance between mutant and redundant wild-type proteins might account for the differences\nwhen meristem termination occurs in individual homozygous l28 mutants.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"62ef27a8","id":"30af5b6b","subj":"460ebd80"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"51acdf2e","id":"19835e64","subj":"dbd8e44"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"53fd0d10","id":"68b32e3e","subj":"34f22f9d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"63787180","id":"bcef303","subj":"2e1ef60"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"79179359","id":"41709512","subj":"1afdd473"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"63787180","id":"42039326","subj":"386f0da3"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"40238dd0","id":"5443d039","subj":"16fdec90"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"53fd0d10","id":"7d1cfb8b","subj":"53de625d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4eb386df","id":"6e4566f1","subj":"7776ab"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6f3c660a","id":"2a62b5bc","subj":"16fdec90"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"6a55299e","id":"4f9a2c08","subj":"7776ab"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"63787180","id":"7dda48d9","subj":"22356acd"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"6c0d9d86","id":"4b6e2263","subj":"4ce1d6d0"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"71812481","id":"344f4dea","subj":"1fde5d22"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"6f3c660a","id":"1b7c473a","subj":"40238dd0"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"535779e4","id":"648c94da","subj":"4ce1d6d0"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"51acdf2e","id":"5e4bd84a","subj":"7776ab"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-16473966-1","denotations":[{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"1b835480","span":{"end":697,"begin":689}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"6e950bcf","span":{"end":697,"begin":693}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"421bba99","span":{"end":940,"begin":911}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"31bcf236","span":{"end":1031,"begin":1016}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"1a760689","span":{"end":118,"begin":78}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"70f59913","span":{"end":118,"begin":98}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"77258e59","span":{"end":127,"begin":120}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"2250b9f2","span":{"end":127,"begin":124}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"4f25b795","span":{"end":458,"begin":449}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"74bada02","span":{"end":692,"begin":689}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"7241a47d","span":{"end":97,"begin":78}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"5dcd8c7a","span":{"end":123,"begin":120}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"525575","span":{"end":737,"begin":733}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"46dffdc3","span":{"end":731,"begin":703}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5a709816","span":{"end":804,"begin":781}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"78383390","span":{"end":777,"begin":772}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"6ad3381f","span":{"end":864,"begin":827}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"53dbe163","span":{"end":785,"begin":781}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"6ee6f53","span":{"end":872,"begin":866}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5d12a356","span":{"end":885,"begin":878}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"134d26af","span":{"end":948,"begin":941}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"66ac5762","span":{"end":955,"begin":941}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4b3ed2f0","span":{"end":1136,"begin":1131}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4fad9bb2","span":{"end":1069,"begin":1064}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"517d4a0d","span":{"end":1146,"begin":1141}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"38831718","span":{"end":1163,"begin":1159}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"33fe57a9","span":{"end":1256,"begin":1251}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"691939c9","span":{"end":1318,"begin":1314}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"e19bb76","span":{"end":1393,"begin":1388}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"61a88b8c","span":{"end":1400,"begin":1395}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5adb0db3","span":{"end":64,"begin":21}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"3f270e0a","span":{"end":71,"begin":66}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"41d426b5","span":{"end":250,"begin":245}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"8dbfffb","span":{"end":318,"begin":313}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"a22cb6a","span":{"end":360,"begin":336}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5dd1c9f2","span":{"end":372,"begin":367}},{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"797cf65c","span":{"end":1077,"begin":1064}},{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"2c1156a7","span":{"end":1201,"begin":1159}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"4982cc36","span":{"end":1263,"begin":1251}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"4f1bfe23","span":{"end":1278,"begin":1271}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"512535ff","span":{"end":1334,"begin":1326}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"22295ec4","span":{"end":20,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"f316aeb","span":{"end":297,"begin":291}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"71529963","span":{"end":1455,"begin":1425}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"7e3181aa","span":{"end":182,"begin":145}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"253d9f73","span":{"end":268,"begin":245}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"142269f2","span":{"end":207,"begin":190}},{"obj":"Environmental_Factor","id":"331acdad","span":{"end":276,"begin":269}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"6aa3a905","span":{"end":381,"begin":367}}],"text":"Arabidopsis

This approach identified two other LRR-RLKs, the BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) receptor and its coreceptor,\nthe SERK3 or BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 protein. In addition, KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, CDC48A, and 14-3-3ν were\nfound. Finally, the MADS box transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 and an uncharacterized zinc finger protein, a member\nof the CONSTANS family, were identified as part of the SERK1 complex. Using blue native gel electrophoresis, we show that\nSERK1 and SERK3 are part of BRI1-containing multiple protein complexes with relative masses between 300 and 500 kD.

leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) play important roles in plant signaling pathways. For\nexample, the Arabidopsis thaliana CLAVATA1 (CLV1), BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), ERECTA, rice (Oryza sativa) Xa21, HAESA-RLK5, and FLS2 genes were shown to function in shoot meristem maintenance, hormone perception, organ elongation,\ndisease resistance, abscission, and flagellin signaling, respectively (reviewed in Torii, 2004). Extensive genetic and biochemical studies have been undertaken to identify additional components of different signaling\npathways. For example, negative and positive regulators of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling were identified as the GSK-3\/Shaggy-like\nkinase called BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2) (Li and Nam, 2002) and the nucleus-localized Ser\/Thr phosphatase bri1 Suppressor1 family (Mora-Garcia et al., 2004), respectively. Their potential substrates are the nuclear proteins BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1) (Wang et al., 2002b) and bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1) (Yin et al., 2002).\nWe previously identified Arabidopsis SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 (SERK1), an LRR-RLK that marks the formation of embryogenic cells in culture\nand is expressed in ovule primordia and in both male and female gametophytes. In sporophytic tissues, SERK1 has a complex\nexpression pattern, with expression being highest in the vascular tissue of all organs (Hecht et al., 2001; Albrecht et al., 2005; Kwaaitaal et al., 2005). Ectopic expression of SERK1 does not result in an obvious phenotype in Arabidopsis plants but increases somatic embryo formation in culture (Hecht et al., 2001). SERK1 is a member of a small family of five related RLKs, all of which have five LRRs and a typical Ser-Pro\u2013rich juxtamembrane\nregion (Hecht et al., 2001). The SERK1 knockout alleles serk1-1 and serk1-2 did not have a morphological phenotype but in combination with a serk2 null mutant resulted in complete male-sterile plants (Albrecht et al., 2005; Colcombet et al., 2005). SERK3 or BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 (BAK1) is part of the BR receptor complex and is proposed to function as a coreceptor\nof the BRI1 protein (Li et al., 2002; Nam and Li, 2002). Recently, we showed that in living plant cells BRI1 and SERK3 interaction occurred in restricted areas of the membrane\nand recycled upon internalization by endocytosis (Russinova et al., 2004).\nSERK1 was shown to interact with the KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE (KAPP) that is postulated to play a role in receptor\ninternalization (Shah et al., 2002). Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, two additional SERK1-interacting proteins, CDC48A and 14-3-3λ, were found (Rienties et\nal., 2005). These interactions suggested analogy with the mammalian CDC48 homologue p97\/VCP complex, in which p97\/VCP can be phosphorylated\nby the JAK-2 kinase and dephosphorylated by the phosphatase PTPH1 that associates with a 14-3-3 protein (Zhang et al., 1997, 1999). KAPP has also been reported to interact with other LRR-RLKs such as HAESA, WALL-ASSOCIATED KINASE1, FLS2, and CLV1 (reviewed\nin Becraft, 2002). Transgenic studies indicate that KAPP functions as a negative regulator of CLV1 and FLS2 signaling (Williams et al., 1997; Stone et al., 1998; Gomez-Gomez et al., 2001).\nIdentification of proteins can now be performed at high sensitivity by specific proteolytic digestion and determination of\nthe peptide masses by mass spectrometry. This technique has been used for a systematic study of multiprotein complexes. For\nthe epidermal growth factor receptor, a human receptor Tyr kinase, immunoprecipitation combined with matrix-assisted laser\ndesorption ionization\u2013time of flight\/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF\/MS) was used to identify components of the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor signaling complex (Pandey et al., 2000). For only a few plant RLKs, the signaling complex has been defined. One example is the 105-kD CLV1 receptor that is found\nin two distinct protein complexes of 450 and 185 kD. The larger 450-kD complex requires functional CLV1 and CLV3 proteins\nfor assembly and includes KAPP and a Rho GTPase-related protein (Trotochaud et al., 1999).\nIn this study, we have determined the composition of the SERK1 complex(es) in vivo. We combined immunoprecipitation of cyan\nfluorescent protein (CFP)\u2013tagged SERK1 with rapid liquid chromatography (LC)\/MALDI-TOF\/MS\u2013based protein identification. Using\nthis method, we confirmed the presence in the SERK1 signaling complex of CDC48A (Rienties et al., 2005) and KAPP (Shah et al., 2002). Additional proteins were also found, such as another member of the 14-3-3 family, 14-3-3ν, SERK3 (BAK1) and BRI1, the MADS\nbox transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15), and an uncharacterized zinc finger protein.\nIn particular, the interaction between SERK1 and BRI1 was confirmed by a genetic experiment and fluorescence lifetime imaging\nmicroscopy (FLIM) to determine Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescently tagged receptors.

this work, we used a combination of coimmunoprecipitation based on the GFP variant CFP as a protein tag and LC\/MALDI-TOF\/MS\nto identify proteins associated with the membrane receptor SERK1. Based on our data with other membrane proteins from Arabidopsis, this technique appears to be of general use. Compared with other techniques to identify interacting proteins, such as in\nvitro pulldown assays and yeast two-hybrid screens, the main advantage is that the immunoprecipitation combined with LC\/MALDI-TOF\/MS\nallows protein complex isolation under native conditions, therefore allowing functional studies in which the activity or posttranslational\nmodification of one or several proteins in the complex can be examined (Drewes and Bouwmeester, 2003). Another advantage is that the CFP tag allows one to directly follow all subcellular localizations of the fusion proteins.\nThis allows predictions concerning the nature of the proteins recovered, especially in the case of membrane receptors undergoing\nrecycling (Russinova et al., 2004). Other tags have been used, such as tandem affinity purification tags for plant protein complex isolation in a transient\nexpression system or in stably transformed transgenic lines, using the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Rohila et al.,\n2004; Rubio et al., 2005). Our procedure differs in several respects: we used an endogenous promoter-based construct and only used CFP as a protein\ntag, thereby minimizing potential biological problems arising from the use of strong constitutive promoters. Also, we used\nintegral membrane protein as a bait, rather than the soluble proteins used previously.\nSERK1 and BR Signaling\nA highly interesting finding was the identification of two members of the BR signaling pathway, the main BR receptor BRI1\n(Li and Chory, 1997) and its coreceptor BAK1 (SERK3) (Li et al., 2002; Nam and Li, 2002), as components of the SERK1 complex. This finding implies that SERK1 is a previously unrecognized element of BR signaling.\nRecently, we showed that the SERK3 receptor may have a role in the internalization of BRI1 after heterodimerization and that\nBRI1 can also form homodimers in the plasma membrane (Russinova et al., 2004). Further biochemical evidence comes from the finding here that BRI1 and SERK1 as well as SERK1 and SERK3 can interact in\nthe plasma membrane of protoplasts. FRET studies between SERK1-CFP and SERK1-YFP have shown that only 15% of SERK1 exists\nas homodimers on the plasma membrane of protoplast cells (Shah et al., 2001a). Our results showed that both SERK1 and SERK3 heterodimerize with the BRI1 receptor, suggesting that both coreceptors can\nhave comparable activity in terms of BRI1 signaling and\/or internalization. Another piece of evidence is that a bak1 null allele shows less severe phenotypes than bri1 loss-of-function alleles, indicating that partially redundant activity could be attributed to different SERK family members\n(Li et al., 2002; Nam and Li, 2002). Genetic analysis of the serk1-1 bri1-119 double mutant suggests that SERK1\u2013BRI1 interactions indeed affect BRI1-mediated signaling in planta, but to a lesser extent\nthan SERK3\u2013BRI1 interactions. Notably, none of the proposed downstream components of BRI1, such as BES1, BZR1, or BIN2 (Li\nand Nam, 2002; Wang et al., 2002b; Yin et al., 2002), was detected in the SERK1 complex.\nIt is unlikely that all proteins (as identified by MALDI-TOF\/MS) listed in Table 1 are present in a complex together with SERK1 at the same time. Especially because proteins such as receptors and CDC48A (Rancour\net al., 2002, 2004) are known to shuttle between monomeric and multimeric forms and can change their interaction properties upon activation\nand relocalization, multiple forms of the same complex are to be expected. An indication of the presence of different complexes\nis the localization of SERK1 in the plasma membrane as well as in internalized membrane compartments (Russinova et al., 2004; Kwaaitaal et al., 2005).\nIt was proposed that BRI1 forms heterodimers with SERK3 to initiate BR signaling upon BR binding (Li et al., 2002; Nam and Li, 2002). This was recently confirmed in an elegant demonstration of the in vivo phosphorylation properties of the BRI1 receptor\n(Wang et al., 2005a). In that work, it was clearly shown that the interaction between the BAK1 (SERK3) proteins and BRI1 is brassinolide-dependent.\nBecause we did not apply exogenous ligands before isolation of the SERK1 complex, it is likely that only a small fraction\nof the complexes we isolated are actively signaling via the SERK1 protein. This notion seems to be supported by the fact that\nmost of the BRI1 receptors were unassociated with SERK1 in seedlings. Although our results do not allow us to precisely predict\nthe composition, it is likely that SERK1, SERK3, and BRI1 receptors can form tetrameric complexes analogous to the functional\ncomplex of transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) receptors. Each type of TGF-ß receptor is also present as a ligand-independent\ndimer on the cell surface. TGF-ß binding to the TßRII homodimers promotes the formation of (TßRI)2\/(TßRII)2 heterodimers, in which TßRI is phosphorylated by the constitutively active TßRII and becomes activated to propagate the TGF-ß\nsignal. Combinatorial interactions in the tetrameric receptor complex allow differential ligand binding or differential signaling\nin response to the same ligand. One receptor combination often binds different ligands, and patterns of ligand and receptor\nexpression dictate which receptor\u2013ligand combination is activated (Feng and Derynck, 1997). This so-called tetrameric model was also recently proposed for BRI1 and BAK1 (SERK3) (Wang et al., 2005b).\nOther SERK1 Complex Components\nThe presence of the PP2C phosphatase KAPP, 14-3-3ν, and CDC48A in the SERK1 complex confirms previously obtained results using\nyeast two-hybrid screening and in vitro interaction\nstudies (Rienties et al., 2005). Collectively, these proteins appear to be involved in dephosphorylation, protein interaction and membrane interaction,\nand protein degradation, respectively. It is likely that they represent receptor maintenance or trafficking functions. Previously,\nit was shown that SERK1 could interact with 14-3-3λ (Rienties et al., 2005). The results presented here suggest that the receptor preferentially interacts with 14-3-3ν in seedlings and perhaps with\n14-3-3λ in siliques, given the origin of the Arabidopsis cDNA library from young silique tissue that was used for yeast two-hybrid screening. The kinase domain of SERK1 is able to\ntransphosphorylate and bind in vitro to CDC48A, 14-3-3λ, and KAPP (Rienties et al., 2005). In vitro, the interactions are all phosphorylation-dependent. In vivo, it was shown that SERK1 interacts with KAPP only\nin intracellular vesicles, and it was proposed to play a role in receptor internalization as well as in dephosphorylation\n(Shah et al., 2002). For two other LRR-RLKs, CLV1 (Williams et al., 1997) and FLS2 (Gomez-Gomez et al., 2001), it has been shown that KAPP functions as a negative regulator, and it may have the same role in controlling signaling through\nthe SERK1 receptor.\nCDC48 protein assembles mainly in hexameric forms (Rancour et al., 2002). In Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, soluble (cytosolic) CDC48A was found in a high molecular mass protein of 640 kD. Recently, it\nwas proposed that CDC48A interacts with PUX1 as a monomer and may function in regulating plant growth (Rancour et al., 2004) and also in the plant endoplasmic reticulum\u2013associated protein degradation system (Muller et al., 2005).\nPlant 14-3-3 proteins have also been found associated with G-box transcription factors (Lu et al., 1992). Five Arabidopsis 14-3-3s, including 14-3-3λ, have been shown to interact with other transcription factors (Pan et al., 1999), and current models propose that the interaction with members of the 14-3-3 family is client-driven (Paul et al., 2005).\nTwo transcription factors were found to be associated with the SERK1 complex: AGL15 and a putative CO-like B-box zinc finger\nprotein. Most likely, these two proteins do not interact directly with the receptor but require 14-3-3 proteins as adaptor\nproteins. It has been shown that 14-3-3 proteins can also promote the cytoplasmic localization or, conversely, the nuclear\nlocalization, of transcription factors (reviewed in Muslin and Xing, 2000). One of the other MADS box transcription factors, AGL24, was shown to interact directly with the kinase domain of the Arabidopsis meristematic receptor-like kinase and to be phosphorylated by the kinase domain of the receptor in vitro (Fujita et al.,\n2003). AGL15 was shown to accumulate in nuclei but also to be present in the cytoplasm (Perry et al., 1996). SERK1 and AGL15 are highly expressed during embryogenic cell formation in culture and during early embryogenesis. As found\nfor SERK1 (Hecht et al., 2001), AGL15 promotes somatic embryo production from the shoot apical meristem in liquid culture when ectopically overexpressed\n(Perry et al., 1996; Harding et al., 2003). Interestingly, AGL15-overexpressing tissues also had increased expression of SERK1 (Harding et al., 2003). It was shown that AGL15 could bind directly to the promoter regions of different targets (Wang et al., 2002a). Those authors described how after chromatin immunoprecipitation, they obtained DNA fragments containing cis-regulatory elements targeted by AGL15, which may contribute to the regulation of the SERK gene by directly binding to its promoter. These data and our findings suggest that SERK1 and AGL15 can be involved in the\nsame signaling pathway.\nThe other putative transcription factor found in the SERK1 complex belongs to a large family of CO-like zinc finger transcription\nfactors, in which the zinc finger region regulates protein\u2013protein interactions, as found for several animal transcription\nfactors (reviewed in Griffiths et al., 2003). Recently, it was shown that CO accumulation is regulated by photoreceptors in photoperiodic flowering (Valverde et al.,\n2004).\nIn conclusion, we propose that in Arabidopsis seedlings, signaling mediated by the SERK1 receptor combines elements of the BR pathway with a short signal transduction\nchain, in which the plasma membrane receptor is in a complex with its cognate transcriptional regulators, such as

embryo development is regulated by a network of transcription factors that include LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC1), LEC1-LIKE (L1L), and B3 domain factors, LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2), FUSCA3 (FUS3), and ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Interactions of these genes result in temporal progression of overlapping B3 gene expression culminating in maturation\nand desiccation of the seed. Three VP1\/ABI3-LIKE (VAL) genes encode B3 proteins that include plant homeodomain-like and CW domains associated with chromatin factors. Whereas val monogenic mutants have phenotypes similar to wild type, val1 val2 double-mutant seedlings form no leaves and develop embryo-like proliferations in root and apical meristem regions. In a val1 background, val2 and val3 condition a dominant variegated leaf phenotype revealing a VAL function in vegetative development. Reminiscent of the pickle (pkl) mutant, inhibition of gibberellin biosynthesis during germination induces embryonic phenotypes in val1 seedlings. Consistent with the embryonic seedling phenotype, LEC1, L1L, ABI3, and FUS3 are up-regulated in val1 val2 seedlings in association with a global shift in gene expression to a profile resembling late-torpedo-stage embryogenesis.\nHence, VAL factors function as global repressors of the LEC1\/B3 gene system. The consensus binding site of the ABI3\/FUS3\/LEC2 B3 DNA-binding domain (Sph\/RY) is strongly enriched in the\npromoters and first introns of VAL-repressed genes, including the early acting LEC1 and L1L genes. We suggest that VAL targets Sph\/RY-containing genes in the network for chromatin-mediated repression in conjunction with the PKL-related CHD3\nchromatin-remodeling factors.\nEmbryo development in plants is regulated by a network of transcription factors that include the LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC1) and LEC1-LIKE (L1L) genes belonging to the HAP3 family CCAAT-binding factors and a subgroup of the plant-specific B3 domain protein family composed\nof the LEC2, FUSCA3 (FUS3), and ABSCISIC ACID (ABA)-INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) genes (Giraudat et al., 1992; Lotan et al., 1998; Luerssen et al., 1998; Stone et al., 2001; Kwong et al., 2003).\nA series of studies have detailed the complex sequential and regional expression patterns and mutual interactions among these\nregulators, which underlie the process of embryo formation (Parcy et al., 1997; Nambara et al., 2000; Raz et al., 2001; Brocard-Gifford et al., 2003; Baumbusch et al., 2004; Kagaya et al., 2005; Santos Mendoza et al., 2005; To et al., 2006). LEC1 and L1L act early in embryogenesis and initiate a complex progression of B3 transcription factor expression associated with the transition\nfrom embryo morphogenesis to embryo maturation and acquisition of desiccation tolerance. RNA interference of L1L function has been shown to cause embryo arrest during morphogenesis (Kwong et al., 2003), whereas lec1 embryos complete morphogenesis and are capable of further development into plants if rescued prior to desiccation of the\nseed (Meinke, 1992, 1994; West et al., 1994). Ectopic expression of LEC1 or L1L is sufficient to induce embryo formation in vegetative organs (Lotan et al., 1998; Kwong et al., 2003). The lec1, fus3, and lec2 mutations cause partial transformation of cotyledons to leaf-like organs (Meinke, 1992, 1994; Keith et al., 1994; West et al., 1994). The fus3 mutant embryos, if rescued, are also viable (Keith et al., 1994; Meinke et al., 1994). Overexpression of LEC2 or FUS3 causes ectopic expression of embryonic traits in vegetative tissues, albeit not as strongly as induced by LEC1 or L1L misexpression (Stone et al., 2001; Tsuchiya et al., 2004). Finally, ABI3 is required for maturation-related and ABA-regulated gene expression and establishment of embryo dormancy during mid-to-late\nembryo development (Koornneef et al., 1984). Null abi3 mutant embryos are morphologically almost normal and viable if rescued prior to desiccation (Giraudat et al., 1992; Nambara et al., 1992, 1994). Plants that ectopically express ABI3 or the maize (Zea mays) ortholog VP1 develop normally, but have dramatically altered ABA-dependent gene expression in vegetative tissues (Parcy et al., 1994; Suzuki et al., 2001).\nA major function of the LEC2, FUS3, and ABI3 B3 transcription factors is activation of genes involved in accumulation of storage protein and lipid reserves in the embryo\nduring seed maturation. Activation of downstream genes is mediated by specific binding of the B3 domain (Suzuki et al., 1997; Kroj et al., 2003; Carranco et al., 2004; Monke et al., 2004; Braybrook et al., 2006) to the Sph\/RY cis-element (Hattori et al., 1992; Kao et al., 1996; Ezcurra et al., 1999; Reidt et al., 2000; Chandrasekharan et al., 2003; Nag et al., 2005). In addition, ABI3 mediates ABA-regulated gene expression in the seed through interaction with specific basic Leu-zipper transcription factors\nthat bind ABA response elements (Finkelstein et al., 2002). FUS3 and LEC2 are implicated in repression of GA biosynthesis during seed development (Curaba et al., 2004; Gazzarrini et al., 2004).

regulation of gene expression is an essential biological event, especially when each transcriptional factor acts\nas a key regulator. In Arabidopsis, the floral meristem produces four concentric whorls of floral organs (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels). According to\nthe \u2018ABC\u2019 model for the determination of floral organ identity, A activity specifies sepals, A and B activities lead to petals,\nB and C activities lead to stamens, and C activity specifies carpels (Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1994).\nThe APETALA2 (AP2) gene, which belongs to the A class of genes, exhibits several characteristics distinct from other ABC genes. Although most\nABC genes contain a MADS domain, AP2 contains two APETALA2\/ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AP2\/EREBP) domains (Jofuku et al., 1994). The AP2 transcript is not observed in a region-specific pattern in the four wholes of flower, and is detected in other vegetative\ntissues (Jofuku et al., 1994; Okamuro et al., 1997). Recent reports showed that AP2 controlled seed mass (Jofuku et al., 1994, 2005; Ohto et al., 2005) and that expression of the AP2 protein was translationally regulated by the microRNA mi172 (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003; Chen, 2004). Thus, AP2 may play an important role in both floral and whole-plant development.\nAP2 belongs to the AP2\/EREBP family, one of the largest groups of plant transcriptional factors (Riechmann et al., 2000). It is known that AP2 suppresses expression of AGAMOUS, the C gene of a floral homeotic gene (Drews et al., 1991; Bomblies et al., 1999). In addition, AP2 regulates the expression of ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) genes containing one AP2\/EREBP domain (Okamuro et al., 1997). However, the relationship of the transcriptional regulation between AP2 and ERF genes is not fully understood.\nPreviously, we characterized Arabidopsis thaliana ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AtEBP), one of the ERF genes, as a transcriptional activator (Ogawa et al., 2005). AtEBP is regulated by an ethylene signal (Büttner and Singh, 1997; Ogawa et al., 2005). It was clarified that AtEBP is regulated by EIN2, but not EIN3, suggesting that AtEBP expression is independently regulated under EIN3 in ethylene signalling. Interestingly, it was reported that AtEBP expression was regulated by AP2 (Okamuro et al., 1997). Nevertheless, relationships between AtEBP and AP2 in ethylene signal transduction have not been investigated in detail.\nHere, we show that AP2 regulates ERF genes such as AtEBP and AtERF1, and the over-expression of AtEBP causes the accumulation of AP2 transcripts.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"533377b","id":"9ed238c","subj":"f27ea3"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"6a66a204","id":"51e8e6e6","subj":"24bdb479"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"4bf3798b","id":"56f6d40b","subj":"10fde30a"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"419a20a6","id":"36676c1a","subj":"3383649e"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"1992eaf4","id":"5b408dc3","subj":"f74e835"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"61bcd567","id":"2dbf4cbd","subj":"458342d3"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"1cd201a8","id":"56276db8","subj":"1992eaf4"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7b64240d","id":"71ae31b0","subj":"55e8ec2f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"2692b61e","id":"4ba534b0","subj":"62fad19"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"350ec41e","id":"6f0ca692","subj":"71984c3"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"4f2613d1","id":"2c104774","subj":"2e54db99"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"69637b10","id":"2cb3d0f7","subj":"350ec41e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"293d0107","id":"4e517165","subj":"2692b61e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"7b64240d","id":"44e3760b","subj":"74cadd41"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"55787112","id":"5860f3d7","subj":"1c9f0a20"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"350ec41e","id":"42f3156d","subj":"2756c0a7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"15c25153","id":"427b5f92","subj":"1252b961"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"6ca0256d","id":"4d098f9b","subj":"5536379e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"46f699d5","id":"7e3060d8","subj":"18518ccf"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"7c56e013","id":"7fc44dec","subj":"3fc9dfc5"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"77602954","id":"6d24ffa1","subj":"64df9a61"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"4275c20c","id":"773f7880","subj":"2c3dec30"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"7c56e013","id":"4c51bb7","subj":"34a97744"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"4275c20c","id":"42a9e5d1","subj":"e260766"},{"pred":"Regulates_Tissue_Development","obj":"40258c2f","id":"5b080f3a","subj":"1d7f7be7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"768ccdc5","id":"65a4798f","subj":"1991f767"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"63192798","id":"878452d","subj":"5ddabb18"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"768ccdc5","id":"426b6a74","subj":"10650953"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"59d2103b","id":"83298d7","subj":"f6c03cb"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"3f1c5af9","id":"665e9289","subj":"277f7dd3"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"6c8bca63","id":"2b491fee","subj":"277f7dd3"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"277f7dd3","id":"50eca7c6","subj":"2364305a"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"277f7dd3","id":"376a312c","subj":"1bc715b8"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"470a696f","id":"28d6290","subj":"277f7dd3"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"292d1c71","id":"38f57b3d","subj":"277f7dd3"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"58670130","id":"1c55f277","subj":"346939bf"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"39dcf4b0","id":"1de5f0ef","subj":"346939bf"},{"pred":"Is_Involved_In_Process","obj":"24bdb479","id":"3e8f7922","subj":"1ddae9b5"},{"pred":"Is_Involved_In_Process","obj":"20b5f2ac","id":"58e6d4b8","subj":"15c25153"},{"pred":"Is_Involved_In_Process","obj":"7db82169","id":"5ef0d29e","subj":"1c9f0a20"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"1992eaf4","id":"2cac4385","subj":"3276732"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"2c7d121c","id":"16f7b4af","subj":"1ce61929"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"659eef7","id":"6731787b","subj":"4c6daf0"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"458342d3","id":"7adf16aa","subj":"1c80e49b"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"69637b10","id":"34a1d21f","subj":"2756c0a7"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"2756c0a7","id":"73c60324","subj":"71984c3"},{"pred":"Is_Linked_To","obj":"74cadd41","id":"58bf8650","subj":"55e8ec2f"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-17204538-4","denotations":[{"obj":"Protein","id":"7a48e6e2","span":{"end":1995,"begin":1991}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"6d0b5baf","span":{"end":2156,"begin":2152}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"186978a6","span":{"end":903,"begin":898}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"3a320ade","span":{"end":1212,"begin":1208}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"7813cb11","span":{"end":1256,"begin":1252}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"bcec031","span":{"end":1397,"begin":1392}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"21005f6c","span":{"end":1340,"begin":1336}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"42b64ab8","span":{"end":1566,"begin":1562}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"305f031","span":{"end":34,"begin":31}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4ebea12c","span":{"end":507,"begin":504}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"2a1edad4","span":{"end":1708,"begin":1704}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"44c79f32","span":{"end":1765,"begin":1761}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"7fcbe147","span":{"end":594,"begin":591}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"3c0fae6c","span":{"end":705,"begi

studies have shown that AP2 plays a global role not only in floral development but also in the control of seed mass\n(Jofuku et al., 1994, 2005; Okamuro et al., 1997; Ohto et al., 2005). In addition, AP2 expression is controlled transcriptionally and translationally in a co-ordinated manner. In particular, micro RNAs are thought\nto target mRNAs of AP2 and its homologs, thereby inhibiting the translation process (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003; Chen, 2004). However, the transcriptional regulation of AP2 has not been well understood (Okamuro et al., 1997).\nThe current study showed that AP2 activity repressed AtEBP, AtERF1 and AP2 expression. This is consistent with previous results showing that AP2 regulates its own AP2 expression (Okamuro et al., 1997; Chen, 2004) as well as other genes, such as the ERF genes.\nIn addition, over-expression of AtEBP increased the expression level of AP2. AtEBP is a transcriptional activator interacting with GCC-box, an ethylene-responsive element (Büttner and Singh, 1997). Although the over-expression of AtEBP up-regulated AP2 and AtERF1 expression, these promoters (∼2·0 kb upstream from ATG) did not contain the GCC-box. Interestingly, analysis of tomato ERF\nPti4 interacting with GCC-box revealed that Pti4 bound to promoters in the absence of GCC-box (Chakravarthy et al., 2003). Like Pti4, transcriptional regulation of the target genes of AtEBP may be complex.\nDown-regulation of AP2 was observed in ein2-1. The null mutation of EIN2 resulted in a complete loss of responsiveness to ethylene, suggesting that EIN2 is essential in\nthe ethylene signal pathway. However, AP2 expression was not induced by ethylene treatment or in ctr1-1, indicating that EIN2 is a receiver for various signals. It is known that EIN2 receives not only ethylene but also other\nsignals, such as paraquat and jasmonic acid (Alonso et al., 1999). The N-terminal of EIN2 is thought to be necessary for ethylene responsiveness. On the other hand, the C-terminal of EIN2\nis required for transducing the signal to the downstream components (Wang et al., 2002).

translation of AP2 mRNA is suppressed by micro RNAs (Chen, 2004) and AP2 protein down-regulates AP2 and AtEBP expression (Okamuro et al., 1997; this study), as indicated in grey. In the current study, it was demonstrated that AP2 expression was regulated through AtEBP and EIN2, and that AtEBP may contribute to floral development, as indicated by in\nblack.\nThe AP2 mRNA level did not change in the ein3-1 mutant. The position of EIN3 is a branch of the ethylene signalling pathway under EIN2. It is known that the sensitivity\nof ein3 mutants to ethylene is weaker than ein2 mutants (Wang et al., 2002). Previous studies reported that both EIN3-dependent and independent pathways exist downstream of EIN2 (Binder et al., 2004; Seifert et al., 2004). Furthermore, AtEBP expression is independently regulated under EIN3 in ethylene signalling (Ogawa et al., 2005; this study). In this study, AP2 was not induced by ethylene despite increasing expression of AtEBP. We suggest that these signal transductions compete with one another.\nAtEBP knockout plants exhibited a weak floral phenotype with a lower number of stamens. An evaluation was also made of AtERF1 and AP2 expression in AtEBP knockout plants having the same level of WT (data not shown). The ctr1 mutants showed an earlier-maturing phenotype in the gyneocium compared with the flower, and ein mutants affect the maturation of the gyneocium (Kieber et al., 1993). Interestingly, the ant mutants show a similar phenotype to the AtEBP knockout plants (Elliott et al., 1996; Klucher et al., 1996). ANT is a member of the AP2\/ERF family containing the AP2\/EREBP domains.\nOver-expression of AtEBP caused up-regulation of AP2 in leaves. Despite the accumulation of AP2 mRNA in transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing AtEBP, no abnormal flowers were observed. Chen (2004) reported that micro RNAs control transcriptional regulation of AP2 expression. That is, most transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing AP2 had normal flowers and only a fraction exhibited the agamous-like phenotype. However, over-expression of AP2 mutated at the target site of micro RNAs demonstrated a more severe floral phenotype. Accumulation of AP2 protein was detected\nonly in transgenic plants over-expressing mutated AP2, not in normal AP2. Thus, we consider that accumulation of AP2 mRNA in Arabidopsis over-expressing AtEBP is not sufficient to change flower development.\nThis study has shown the mutual relationships between AP2 and AtEBP. AtEBP and functional EIN2 affected the transcriptional regulation of AP2. AtEBP contributed slightly to flower development, especially stamen development. Future reports in this series will focus\non the homeotic role of AtEBP.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"751d3241","id":"76c7beb3","subj":"2f058b8a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"29a60c27","id":"64337702","subj":"1849db1a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"51e4ccb3","id":"4204541c","subj":"46e8a539"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5fb97279","id":"3e2822","subj":"439a8f59"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"6a62689d","id":"1e044120","subj":"51df223b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5fd62371","id":"2cf23c81","subj":"2b62442c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"71e5f61d","id":"3624da92","subj":"5bda80bf"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"69c79f09","id":"35fe2125","subj":"1849db1a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"60d8c0dc","id":"94f6bfb","subj":"51df223b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"51e4ccb3","id":"34645867","subj":"47da3952"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5fd62371","id":"60b71e8f","subj":"28a0fd6c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"439a8f59","id":"464649c","subj":"1a1da881"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5bda80bf","id":"5f59185e","subj":"2ce86164"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"2d10e0b1","id":"2cf92cc7","subj":"172ca72b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"6a988392","id":"30ea8c23","subj":"5b6813df"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"5ac86ba5","id":"7b139eab","subj":"2c9399a4"},{"pred":"Regulates_Accumulation","obj":"119f1f2a","id":"4e76dac","subj":"5b970f7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"165b8a71","id":"611df6e3","subj":"119f1f2a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"1e5f4170","id":"5f2f577","subj":"841e575"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"18a3962d","id":"452ba1db","subj":"117e0fe5"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6f80fafe","id":"76a36b71","subj":"3af17be2"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"165b8a71","id":"60fa3495","subj":"5b970f7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"1ca25c47","id":"5d465e4b","subj":"5fcacc0"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"1d71006f","id":"53e211ee","subj":"89ff02e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"5ac86ba5","id":"4215838f","subj":"9635fa"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"533b266e","id":"2289aca5","subj":"5fcacc0"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"6e521c1e","id":"184497d1","subj":"5f4d427e"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"2c9399a4","id":"79e18e38","subj":"9635fa"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4b85880b","id":"f9d87b","subj":"2a65bb85"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4f936da8","id":"6ffab045","subj":"4b85880b"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"5ac86ba5","id":"5e8f9e2d","subj":"2c9399a4"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"119f1f2a","id":"fd46303","subj":"5b970f7"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"5c48c0c0","id":"26fb628","subj":"362a019c"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"71e5f61d","id":"35beb15e","subj":"5bda80bf"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"5c48c0c0","id":"3e2943ab","subj":"10c8f62"},{"pred":"Is_Linked_To","obj":"47da3952","id":"4602c2a9","subj":"46e8a539"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-17999645-2","denotations":[{"obj":"Genotype","id":"64bc21ac","span":{"end":328,"begin":317}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"71c5b236","span":{"end":413,"begin":402}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"7bf9b098","span":{"end":226,"begin":221}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"5d25e6bb","span":{"end":272,"begin":260}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"72f46e16","span":{"end":37,"begin":33}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"3c9168dc","span":{"end":92,"begin":67}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"32232e55","span":{"end":106,"begin":102}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"77307458","span":{"end":244,"begin":240}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"9d157ff","span":{"end":359,"begin":354}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"5df417a7","span":{"end":342,"begin":337}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"7c041b41","span":{"end":380,"begin":376}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"7f69d591","span":{"end":370,"begin":361}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"1cb3ec38","span":{"end":391,"begin":382}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"61078690","span":{"end":431,"begin":402}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"403132fc","span":{"end":431,"begin":426}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"7859e786","span":{"end":487,"begin":482}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"285d851a","span":{"end":574,"begin":570}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"314b8f2d","span":{"end":539,"begin":534}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"664a9613","span":{"end":623,"begin":618}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5118388b","span":{"end":590,"begin":585}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"15a902e7","span":{"end":721,"begin":716}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4a3e3e8b","span":{"end":731,"begin":726}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5af28b27","span":{"end":5,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4985cbcb","span":{"end":32,"begin":28}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"332a7fce","span":{"end":72,"begin":67}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"54361a9","span":{"end":101,"begin":98}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5217f3d0","span":{"end":157,"begin":153}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"37ebc9d8","span":{"end":171,"begin":166}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"293bb8a5","span":{"end":164,"begin":159}}

a member of the core SIN3\/HDAC complex, was recovered as an AGL15-interacting protein. The SIN\/HDAC complex generally consists of eight proteins: SIN3, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, RbAp48, SAP30, SAP18 and SDS3. However, yeast has only one HDAC, and lacks the SAP proteins (reviewed by Silverstein and Ekwall, 2005). Arabidopsis has two HDAC1 orthologs, HDA19 (At4g38130) and HDA6 (At5g63110), and the Arabidopsis ortholog of SAP18 has recently been shown to interact directly with HDA19 (Song and Galbraith, 2006). We show here that SAP18 is also able to interact with HDA6, and that AGL15 can directly interact with HDA19 (Figure 1). Although the C-domain alone is not sufficient to mediate an interaction between AGL15 and SAP18, it is necessary (Figure 1).\n","relations":[{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"314b8f2d","id":"591e58fa","subj":"285d851a"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"4a3e3e8b","id":"3954d008","subj":"15a902e7"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7bf9b098","id":"2f94c4db","subj":"77307458"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7bf9b098","id":"593e824f","subj":"5d25e6bb"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7c041b41","id":"669513d8","subj":"64bc21ac"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"64bc21ac","id":"4a8a60bc","subj":"5df417a7"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"64bc21ac","id":"361c294e","subj":"9d157ff"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"7859e786","id":"72ccd81a","subj":"61078690"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"664a9613","id":"6d8792db","subj":"5118388b"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"5af28b27","id":"493dfb8e","subj":"332a7fce"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"7f69d591","id":"ce5a68e","subj":"9d157ff"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"7c041b41","id":"2f162cc0","subj":"5df417a7"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"5df417a7","id":"2cab9998","subj":"9d157ff"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"7c041b41","id":"2f7a7219","subj":"1cb3ec38"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"5af28b27","id":"3a1d593e","subj":"3c9168dc"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-17999645-5","denotations":[{"obj":"Protein","id":"2fab4aff","span":{"end":1499,"begin":1495}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"6e46d9f4","span":{"end":1435,"begin":1430}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"11dee337","span":{"end":1790,"begin":1785}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"460f76a6","span":{"end":1784,"begin":1780}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"55f3c410","span":{"end":1891,"begin":1887}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4a8ab068","span":{"end":1897,"begin":1892}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"62923ee6","span":{"end":2125,"begin":2120}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4089713","span":{"end":2087,"begin":2082}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"f19c9d2","span":{"end":2250,"begin":2244}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"7807ac2c","span":{"end":2206,"begin":2201}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"b91d8c4","span":{"end":2308,"begin":2283}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"a77614d","span":{"end":2315,"begin":2310}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4fd4cae3","span":{"end":2292,"begin":2283}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4a067c25","span":{"end":5,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"a1217f9","span":{"end":133,"begin":128}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"3bde62ff","span":{"end":217,"begin":212}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"319dead1","span":{"end":398,"begin":395}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"791cbf87","span":{"end":402,"begin":399}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"a7e2d9d","span":{"end":483,"begin":478}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"2f08c4b","span":{"end":934,"begin":929}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"7de0c6ae","span":{"end":1130,"begin":1125}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"cdc3aae","span":{"end":1186,"begin":1182}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"7ef2d7a6","span":{"end":1152,"begin":1149}},{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"29cfd92b","span":{"end":1790,"begin":1780}},{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"11acdc30","span":{"end":1897,"begin":1887}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"7997b197","span":{"end":1508,"begin":1503}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"7f811d00","span":{"end":2081,"begin":2075}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"4b6166aa","span":{"end":2282,"begin":2271}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"770d4269","span":{"end":1997,"begin":1992}},{"obj":"Box","id":"523424b5","span":{"end":238,"begin":228}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"2baa8d82","span":{"end":389,"begin":372}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"754777cd","span":{"end":527,"begin":510}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"372ea2bc","span":{"end":701,"begin":690}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"4cc76301","span":{"end":675,"begin":660}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"3f19b8b3","span":{"end":722,"begin":707}},{"obj":"Protein_Domain","id":"5dcbb60","span":{"end":1396,"begin":1383}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"2b52c0d6","span":{"end":579,"begin":576}},{"obj":"Environmental_Factor","id":"a486d78","span":{"end":1093,"begin":1077}}],"text":"AGL15 induces expression of some direct downstream target genes, and represses the expression others\nDownstream target genes of AGL15 have previously been identified of which expression is induced in response to AGL15 binding a CArG motif within the promoter region (Wang et al., 2002, 2004). In the transient expression assay, when the effector lacked any portion of the C-terminal domain, the GUS\/LUC reporter ratio was no different than the no-effector control, but forms of AGL15 that included part of the C-terminal domain often, but not always, showed activation of the GUS reporter gene. These effectors (deletions A and B) included a conserved region (LENETLNRRQxxELR). but not the LxLxL motif. The LENETLNRRQxxELR motif (Figure 2) contains a number of glutamine, asparagine and acidic residues, and may under certain configurations function as an activation domain (Titz et al., 2006). Alternately, activation of direct AGL15 downstream targets (Wang et al., 2002, 2004; S. Perry, unpublished data) may be mediated via its association with transcriptional activators. Yeast two-hybrid studies have demonstrated that AGL15 can interact with AP1 (de Folter et al., 2005) and SEP3 (Figure 4), both of which have reported transactivation functions (Cho et al., 1999; Honma and Goto, 2001; Ng and Yanofsky, 2001; Pelaz et al., 2001). It is interesting to note that the conserved LENETLNRRQxxE motif resides within a region of AGL15 that is necessary and sufficient to allow interaction with SEP3 in yeast (data not shown).\nThere are numerous examples in the literature of protein interactions determining whether a protein acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor. Known transcriptional activators have been shown to exert a repressive function through recruitment of SIN3\/HDAC1 (Cheng and Bishop, 2002; Yang et al., 1996; Zhu et al., 2001). Co-activators that interact with SIN3\/HDAC1 members, giving the complex an activator function, have also been reported. In the literature HDACs are generally associated with the repression of gene expression; however, in plants HDA19 has been shown to interact with bnKCP, and exerts a modest transactivation of reporter genes (Gao et al., 2003). HDA19 has also been shown to interact with BnSCL1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis SCARECROW-like protein 15 (SCL15), and likewise exerts transcriptional activation of reporter genes (Gao et al., 2004).\n","relations":[{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"62923ee6","id":"1bdf8190","subj":"4089713"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"7807ac2c","id":"192f2f27","subj":"f19c9d2"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"7ef2d7a6","id":"644c78d4","subj":"a486d78"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"7de0c6ae","id":"532a02d9","subj":"a486d78"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"cdc3aae","id":"7bb3a9fe","subj":"a486d78"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"754777cd","id":"8a589a2","subj":"a7e2d9d"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"6e46d9f4","id":"6b5176f2","subj":"5dcbb60"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4b6166aa","id":"c65a5ef","subj":"b91d8c4"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7997b197","id":"6bab2585","subj":"2fab4aff"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7997b197","id":"74bdc168","subj":"6e46d9f4"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7f811d00","id":"611f8234","subj":"4089713"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"7f811d00","id":"7cbee484","subj":"62923ee6"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"7ef2d7a6","id":"b672aa8","subj":"7de0c6ae"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"7de0c6ae","id":"ec0c838","subj":"cdc3aae"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"523424b5","id":"5cc69cfe","subj":"3bde62ff"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"6e46d9f4","id":"21c64522","subj":"2fab4aff"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"b91d8c4","id":"1922e6d","subj":"a77614d"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"f19c9d2","id":"76a82f33","subj":"a77614d"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-17999645-6","denotations":[{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"4a9cc6cb","span":{"end":3670,"begin":3660}},{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"46c670a6","span":{"end":2655,"begin":2645}},{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"2fd1731c","span":{"end":2840,"begin":2830}},{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"59aa20b3","span":{"end":2992,"begin":2982}},{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"363f6148","span":{"end":3063,"begin":3053}},{"obj":"Protein_Complex","id":"64f857e7","span":{"end":1822,"begin":1812}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5990e6c5","span":{"end":3565,"begin":3560}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"1950e8a6","span":{"end":3552,"begin":3547}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"c9413d8","span":{"end":2405,"begin":2400}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"3b9d6699","span":{"end":3664,"begin":3660}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"7caa550","span":{"end":3670,"begin":3665}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"782a4fff","span":{"end":2650,"begin":2645}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"59fc684e","span":{"end":2704,"begin":2699}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5ae81e1","span":{"end":2655,"begin":2651}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5ae76500","span":{"end":2714,"begin":2709}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"6063d80a","span":{"end":2835,"begin":2830}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"355e34c7","span":{"end":3475,"begin":3470}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"3bd7f8dc","span":{"end":2840,"begin":2836}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"1eba372c","span":{"end":2900,"begin":2895}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"1a69561c","span":{"end":2987,"begin":2982}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4b21844c","span":{"end":2992,"begin":2988}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"1b28f282","span":{"end":5,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"138fe6ec","span":{"end":43,"begin":38}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"5e77f0f4","span":{"end":49,"begin":45}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"19b30c92","span":{"end":59,"begin":54}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4a9e6faf","span":{"end":306,"begin":301}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"7eb01b12","span":{"end":3058,"begin":3053}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"e6516e","span":{"end":3063,"begin":3059}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"21d5c1a0","span":{"end":365,"begin":360}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"9f46d94","span":{"end":664,"begin":659}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4cc547a","span":{"end":792,"begin":787}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"4152d38d","span":{"end":782,"begin":777}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"758f4f03","span":{"end":980,"begin":975}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"e24ddd0","span":{"end":1171,"begin":1166}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"1095f122","span":{"end":1822,"begin":1818}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"58c540cf","span":{"end":1817,"begin":1812}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"56e07a08","span":{"end":3610,"begin":3601}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"724f138e","span":{"end":2228,"begin":2213}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"4816c290","span":{"end":3811,"begin":3807}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"548e76f1","span":{"end":1243,"begin":1238}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"1ac85b0c","span":{"end":1321,"begin":1312}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"3aa3193a","span":{"end":1423,"begin":1415}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"59a67c3a","span":{"end":1451,"begin":1447}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"6bc248ed","span":{"end":1690,"begin":1685}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"ca27722","span":{"end":1704,"begin":1695}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"78461bc4","span":{"end":1794,"begin":1785}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"35d6ca49","span":{"end":3530,"begin":3525}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"47289387","span":{"end":3490,"begin":3485}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"12cd9150","span":{"end":3501,"begin":3492}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"114a85c2","span":{"end":2137,"begin":2133}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"f415a95","span":{"end":2132,"begin":2127}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"37eeec90","span":{"end":2362,"begin":2357}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"32fe9

binds directly to and represses LEA76, CBF2 and AGL18 in planta\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that autoregulatory loops are a common phenomenon in the regulation of MADS-box genes in plants (Gómez-Mena et al., 2005; Honma and Goto, 2000; Zhu and Perry, 2005). We previously reported that AGL15 represses AGL15 transcription (Zhu and Perry, 2005). AGL15 can also directly associate with regulatory regions of AGL18 and repress accumulation of AGL18 transcript (Figure 5a,b). No noticeable increase in AGL18 transcription has been observed in plants homozygous for null alleles of AGL15 (Figure 5b) or vice versa (unpublished data), but given that AGL15 is able to repress its own transcription (Zhu and Perry, 2005), and the close similarity and redundancy between AGL15 and AGL18 (Adamczyk et al., 2007), it is possible that any increase in expression is masked by a subsequent autorepression or higher levels of redundancy involving other MADS-domain proteins.\nAGL15 binds the promoter of LEA76 and represses its transcription. There is an increase in LEA76 transcript accumulation in agl15 plants, and, conversely, a decrease in response to increased AGL15 levels in all tissues tested. In contrast to what was observed in seeds, no noticeable difference in CBF2 transcript between agl15-2 and Ws seedlings was observed, which could be result from genetic redundancy with other MADS expressed in the seedling but not present in the seed. There are numerous examples of genetic redundancy and complex regulatory interactions among plant MADS-box genes (for a review, see Gutierrez-Cortines and Davies, 2000). However, CBF2 is repressed, although not as drastically as in seeds, in seedlings constitutively expressing AGL15 relative to wild-type plants, and is induced in seedlings accumulating the AGL15-VP16 fusion protein (Figure 5a). In support of this observation, we have performed crosses between plants carrying a GUS reporter gene under the control of the CBF2 promoter (Fowler et al., 2005, generously donated by Prof. Michael Thomashow, Michigan State University), and an AGL15 overexpresser line or an AGL15-VP16 overexpresser line. The latter showed stronger GUS staining throughout the entire seedling, whereas the former appeared to have less GUS activity relative to the uncrossed pCBF2:GUS control (K. Hill, unpublished data).\nLEA76, CBF2 (Figure 5a) and other putative AGL15 downstream target genes (K. Hill, H. Wang and S.E. Perry, unpublished data), are not as highly induced by ectopic expression of AGL15-VP16 as expected, especially when compared with levels of AGL18 transcript accumulation brought about by AGL15-VP16 (Figure 5a). It has been demonstrated that AGL15 and AGL18 perform at least partially redundant functions (Adamczyk et al., 2007, S. Perry, unpublished data), and given that AGL15-VP16 induces accumulation of AGL18 transcript (Figure 5a), AGL18 might be subsequently repressing CBF2 and LEA76, and thus masking to some degree AGL15-VP16-mediated transcription, although an increase in response to AGL15-VP16 is still apparent.\nEctopic expression of SAP18 alone repressed LEA and CBF2 (Figure 5a), possibly through interaction with AGL15 that is expressed in non-transgenic seedlings or through interaction with other DNA-binding proteins. However, AGL15 and AGL18 levels were unaffected by ectopic expression of SAP18 alone, possibly indicating a more specific interaction at these loci. We have demonstrated that AGL15 binds to LEA76 (At1g52690) (Figure 6a), and that LEA76 is repressed by AGL15 and\/or SAP18 in a variety of tissues, including seedlings (Figure 5).

of Arabidopsis thaliana seed maturation (MAT) genes is controlled by members of several transcription factor families, such as basic leucine zippers\n(bZIPs), B3s, MYBs, and DOFs. In this work, we identify Arabidopsis bZIP53 as a novel transcriptional regulator of MAT genes. bZIP53 expression in developing seeds precedes and overlaps that of its target genes. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches indicate\na correlation between the amount of bZIP53 protein and MAT gene expression. Specific in vivo and in vitro binding of bZIP53\nprotein to a G-box element in the albumin 2S2 promoter is demonstrated. Importantly, heterodimerization with bZIP10 or bZIP25, previously described bZIP regulators of\nMAT gene expression, significantly enhances DNA binding activity and produces a synergistic increase in target gene activation.\nFull-level target gene activation is strongly correlated with the ratio of the correspondent bZIP heterodimerization partners.\nWhereas bZIP53 does not interact with ABI3, a crucial transcriptional regulator in Arabidopsis seeds, ternary complex formation between the bZIP heterodimers and ABI3 increases the expression of MAT genes in planta.\nWe therefore propose that

binds to the AW-box with two core motifs\nThe WRI1 binding sites in the upstream regions of Pl-PKβ1, KAS1, BCCP2, and SUS2 contained the conserved AW-box sequence 5\u2032-[CnTnG](n)7[CG]-3\u2032 (Figure 4f), and mutational analysis of the site 1 AW-box of Pl-PKβ1 indicated that each of the five conserved nucleotides is critical for WRI1 binding (Figure 5c).\nThe DNA-binding activity of Arabidopsis ANT has been characterized previously. Repeated selection of random oligonucleotides that bind with a recombinant ANT fragment corresponding to two AP2 domains results in enrichment of oligonucleotides with a consensus sequence of 5\u2032-gCAC(A\/G)N(A\/T)TcCC(a\/g)ANG(c\/t)-3\u2032 (Nole-Wilson and Krizek, 2000). Although the AW-box sequences do not match to this sequence, there are some similarities between them. The ANT- and WRI1-binding site sequences are both longer than those for transcription factors with single AP2 domain. The 3\u2032-half of the 16-bp ANT-binding sequence is similar to the DRE sequences (CCGAC), to which EREBP-like single AP2 domain factors binds, suggesting that two AP2 domains of ANT uniquely participate in DNA binding (Nole-Wilson and Krizek, 2000; Krizek, 2003). The opposite strand sequence of the ANT-binding consensus sequence, 5\u2032-(g\/a)CnT(t\/c)GggA(A\/T)n-(T\/C)GTGc-3\u2032, shows the [CnTnG] core of the AW-box in the 5\u2032-half, while the sequence of the 3\u2032-half is TG rather than CG in the AW-box.\nThe AP2-type transcription factors characterized previously act as important key regulators in meristem function and organ development. For example, AP2 is a class A floral homeotic gene (Bowman et al., 1989; Jofuku et al., 1994; Okamuro et al., 1997) and it is also involved in control of seed size (Ohto et al., 2005). ANT regulates ovule development and floral organ growth (Elliott et al., 1996; Mizukami and Fischer, 2000), and PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2 are required for stem cell specification and maintenance in the root meristem (Aida et al., 2004). The AP-2 type transcription factors from various plant species have been classified into three major lineages (Kim et al., 2006), and WRI1 and two other related factors [WRI1\/ASML1-related Two-1 (WAT1; At1g16060) and -2 (WAT2; At1g79700)] of Arabidopsis are in the lineage different from the ANT lineage.

directly enhances the expression of genes involved in glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis\nFactors controlling the overall level of oil stored in seeds of A. thaliana, and the integration of this biochemical process in the complex framework of seed development, are only partially characterized (Santos Mendoza et al., 2008). Complementary expression analyses and transcriptomic approaches have demonstrated that the biosynthetic pathways for fatty acids and lipids are largely regulated at the transcriptional level in maturing seeds (Ruuska et al., 2002). The \u2018contrapuntal\u2019 or differential timing of the expression of genes involved in oil metabolism during seed development most probably reflects distinct regulatory pathways controlling the transcription of different sets of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and TAG assembly, respectively. As groups of enzymes within a pathway sometimes exhibit similar regulation, it has been postulated that those members of a given pathway might share common cis- and trans-regulatory elements. For instance, a number of genes encoding enzymes of the glycolysis and the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway display a bell-shaped pattern of expression between 5 and 13 DAA (Ruuska et al., 2002). This is corroborated in our study by qRT-PCR experiments aimed at characterizing the steady-state accumulation of BCCP2 and PKp-β1 mRNAs among a developmental series of maturing siliques (Figure 3a) or seeds (Figure S1). The WRI1 transcription factor, previously shown to represent a node in the regulatory network controlling oilseed metabolism (Cernac and Benning, 2004), was proposed to trigger the transcription of the set of genes involved in the conversion of sucrose into fatty acids. This hypothesis was based on the analysis of the expression profiles of putative target genes of WRI1 characterized in various wri1 mutant backgrounds, and in tissues overexpressing WRI1 ectopically (Ruuska et al., 2002; Baud et al., 2007a). In this study, the use of the uidA reporter gene, the expression of which is driven by full-length promoter sequences of either BCCP2 or PKp-β1, further establishes that WRI1 is able to strongly modulate the activity of these two promoters in planta (Figure 4a,b). Finally, EMSA (Figure 8) and yeast one-hybrid experiments (Figure 7a) demonstrate that WRI1 is able to interact with the BCCP2 promoter, strongly suggesting that this gene is a direct target of WRI1 in planta. It is noteworthy that the fine characterization of the changes in mRNA accumulation for BCCP2, PKp-β1 and WRI1 throughout silique development shows that the induction of the regulatory factor precedes the induction of its targets in the Col-0 accession (Figure 3). This slight delay in the detection of mRNAs corresponding to target genes of WRI1 may presumably illustrate biochemical processes occurring in embryo cells, such as translation of the WRI1 peptide, and post-translational regulations (e.g. translocation of WRI1 towards the nucleus or putative recruitment of its interacting partners).\nWhereas Cernac and Benning (2004) have reported that expression of WRI1 cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-promoter leads to slightly increased seed oil content, neither the Pro35Sdual:WRI1 nor the ProS2:WRI1 transgene used in the present study efficiently stimulates oil accumulation in the corresponding transgenic seeds (Tables 1 and 2). Several factors like growth conditions or strength and specificity of the different promoters used (classical Pro35S versus Pro35Sdual or ProS2) may explain these apparent discrepancies. However, it is also interesting to note that the transgenes considered have been introduced in different A. thaliana accessions (Col-0 versus Ws backgrounds). In the Ws background (this study), the endogenous expression level of glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic genes is significantly higher than in the Col-0 accession (Figure S1). Likewise, fatty acid concentration is more elevated in mature dry seeds of the Ws accession (see Figure 1c in Baud et al., 2007a). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that expression of lipogenic genes may be more limiting in a Col-0 background than in a Ws background.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7dac3fd8","id":"7249dadf","subj":"133e019b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"60d84f61","id":"4362d7df","subj":"39c11e6c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5528a42c","id":"66238be2","subj":"54ec8cc9"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7db0565c","id":"1c25b8a7","subj":"54ec8cc9"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"473b3b7a","id":"200606de","subj":"443dbe42"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"72bca894","id":"750fe12e","subj":"433ffad1"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"443dbe42","id":"3e587920","subj":"1734f68"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"433ffad1","id":"345e5a17","subj":"344344fa"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"39c11e6c","id":"5ea502e0","subj":"324dcd31"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"503d56b5","id":"2a7b6f69","subj":"433ffad1"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7dac3fd8","id":"70eecdc2","subj":"41382722"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"51a06cbe","id":"f8908f6","subj":"49a64d82"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"669253b7","id":"24f43aa3","subj":"49a64d82"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"669253b7","id":"63fd4873","subj":"51a06cbe"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"66d23e4a","id":"7957dc72","subj":"344561e0"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"503d56b5","id":"6ab72419","subj":"344344fa"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"5305c37d","id":"3aacf32a","subj":"32f61a31"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"72bca894","id":"82c57b3","subj":"344344fa"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5305c37d","id":"4fdfa676","subj":"29539e36"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5305c37d","id":"5be82d43","subj":"ec2bf82"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"3dddbe65","id":"600b0b7","subj":"344561e0"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"32f61a31","id":"372b0d86","subj":"29539e36"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"66d23e4a","id":"47747fb9","subj":"3dddbe65"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"32f61a31","id":"213e3629","subj":"ec2bf82"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"4e9658b5","id":"d816dde","subj":"c41709a"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"20312893","id":"6e33c391","subj":"1e886a5b"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"1e886a5b","id":"6c451c9c","subj":"c41709a"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"4e9658b5","id":"31c269fd","subj":"20312893"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-19719479-4","denotations":[{"obj":"Protein","id":"3caa4757","span":{"end":1001,"begin":997}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"547e29a4","span":{"end":1227,"begin":1223}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"c8b96ec","span":{"end":1552,"begin":1548}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"1804f60d","span":{"end":995,"begin":988}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"436390f4","span":{"end":743,"begin":736}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"3228d990","span":{"end":946,"begin":939}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"50b8ae8d","span":{"end":960,"begin":951}},{"obj":"Box","id":"238b521e","span":{"end":1065,"begin":1059}},{"obj":"Box","id":"588ab592","span":{"end":1404,"begin":1398}},{"obj":"Box","id":"3c291aad","span":{"end":497,"begin":491}},{"obj":"Box","id":"320e400","span":{"end":638,"begin":613}},{"obj":"Environmental_Factor","id":"1b39fd82","span":{"end":1270,"begin":1263}},{"obj":"Environmental_Factor","id":"3e2fc448","span":{"end":1243,"begin":1235}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"21680803","span":{"end":1434,"begin":1420}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"2024293c","span":{"end":56,"begin":30}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"c074c0c","span":{"end":56,"begin":40}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"5167268","span":{"end":1787,"begin":1761}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"6ebd78d1","span":{"end":1787,"begin":1771}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"4cc61eb1","span":{"end":1425,"begin":1420}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"2d8f2f3a","span":{"end":35,"begin":30}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"7048f722","span":{"end":46,"begin":40}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"1cfd1875","span":{"end":1766,"begin":1761}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"2c444798","span":{"end":1777,"begin":1771}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"6d1310f6","span":{"end":851,"begin":827}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"58a55449","span":{"end":242,"begin":204}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"5949eba8","span":{"end":228,"begin":204}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"6e0ff644","span":{"end":242,"begin":236}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"28c0b664","span":{"end":710,"begin":703}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"1af7f54a","span":{"end":749,"begin":703}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"4d157787","span":{"end":749,"begin":725}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"54e7391d","span":{"end":901,"begin":896}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"58dea0a5","span":{"end":470,"begin":447}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"7728643a","span":{"end":1651,"begin":1634}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"68ed96ca","span":{"end":867,"begin":858}}],"text":"Functional dissections of the BCCP2 and PKp-β1 promoters have led to the identification of enhancing regions of 54 and 79 bp, respectively, that are essential to direct the activity of these promoters in oil-accumulating tissues of the embryo. Comparison of these enhancer elements using PLACE reveals the presence of shared nucleotide sequences that may constitute putative recognition sequences bound by the transcriptional machinery triggering fatty acid biosynthesis. The hexanucleotide AACCCA that can be observed on the minus strand of each enhancer element has previously been described as the core of the SEF3-recognition sequence (Allen et al., 1989). This DNA binding factor was identified in nuclear extracts from developing soybean seeds, and was initially presented as a positive regulator of transcription of the β-conglycinin, α-subunit gene. SEF3-like activities were reported in seeds of other oleaginous species, such as tobacco and sunflower (Lessard et al., 1991). In soybean, SEF3 was shown to bind specifically to a site composed of two AACCCA elements separated by 27 bp (Allen et al., 1989). Nevertheless, complementary studies then established that mutations abolishing the protein binding of this SEF3 factor in vitro did not affect the in vivo promoter activity in a significant manner (Fujiwara and Beachy, 1994). Similarly, in this study, we show that mutations in the AACCCA element of the BCCP2 promoter (m2; Figure 5b) do not impact on promoter activity (Figure 6). These results strongly suggest that isolated core SEF3 recognition sequences do not constitute essential cis-regulatory elements of the lipogenic pathway.\nBy carefully analysing the results of the functional dissections carried out on the enhancer regions of the BCCP2 and PKp-β1 promoters, it is possible to identify a DNA sequence highly conserved between the two promoters that is important for their activity (Figure 5).\n","relations":[{"pred":"Composes_Primary_Structure","obj":"3c291aad","id":"1d572e62","subj":"320e400"},{"pred":"Composes_Primary_Structure","obj":"588ab592","id":"46cf05f7","subj":"21680803"},{"pred":"Composes_Primary_Structure","obj":"3c291aad","id":"5851bd4f","subj":"c074c0c"},{"pred":"Composes_Primary_Structure","obj":"3c291aad","id":"7cd1ac19","subj":"2024293c"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"68ed96ca","id":"29caf222","subj":"54e7391d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"58a55449","id":"2f40a43","subj":"2024293c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"58a55449","id":"69c43e48","subj":"c074c0c"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"3caa4757","id":"3a80515c","subj":"238b521e"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"68ed96ca","id":"1c807b1d","subj":"50b8ae8d"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"3caa4757","id":"2a2bb0eb","subj":"1804f60d"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"68ed96ca","id":"2d0566ba","subj":"3228d990"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"238b521e","id":"733037","subj":"1804f60d"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-21123653-1","denotations":[{"obj":"Genotype","id":"2fa7ae9","span":{"end":480,"begin":464}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"ea27e34","span":{"end":527,"begin":523}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"7bd69e82","span":{"end":701,"begin":697}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"51b01960","span":{"end":751,"begin":747}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"79f227a9","span":{"end":39,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"a23a01d","span":{"end":244,"begin":235}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"3704122f","span":{"end":455,"begin":448}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"27dc79f7","span":{"end":820,"begin":804}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"1bdaa23d","span":{"end":988,"begin":962}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"3301500b","span":{"end":341,"begin":325}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"24b52d3e","span":{"end":301,"begin":281}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"15deb1dc","span":{"end":422,"begin":373}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"6e9c413e","span":{"end":399,"begin":373}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"3a45c42a","span":{"end":445,"begin":431}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"60afd40d","span":{"end":518,"begin":489}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"6b85300e","span":{"end":776,"begin":752}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"2b27cc70","span":{"end":988,"begin":885}},{"obj":"Regulatory_Network","id":"619bd14c","span":{"end":126,"begin":99}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"3f2049b6","span":{"end":488,"begin":481}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"10b3df93","span":{"end":546,"begin":528}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"e72dba7","span":{"end":546,"begin":539}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"6831d8fd","span":{"end":709,"begin":702}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"3aaf4f07","span":{"end":859,"begin":852}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"6ca320ab","span":{"end":19,"begin":12}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"57a4d5ee","span":{"end":422,"begin":404}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"5af5def9","span":{"end":399,"begin":389}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"33a2499c","span":{"end":601,"begin":595}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"5cbf9e9f","span":{"end":828,"begin":822}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"18e8473e","span":{"end":875,"begin":860}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"7674a051","span":{"end":78,"begin":70}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"6754ef00","span":{"end":85,"begin":80}},{"obj":"RNA","id":"323e8306","span":{"end":171,"begin":165}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"33c2bd","span":{"end":628,"begin":623}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"1dfd5f51","span":{"end":618,"begin":613}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"2c22a348","span":{"end":657,"begin":652}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"74d7184a","span":{"end":667,"begin":662}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"50d68830","span":{"end":39,"begin":28}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"1e53135d","span":{"end":45,"begin":41}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"4acf72b6","span":{"end":264,"begin":260}},{"obj":"Gene","id":"7561db12","span":{"end":239,"begin":235}},{"obj":"Gene_Family","id":"6f6a7463","span":{"end":863,"begin":860}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"3a7704c","span":{"end":97,"begin":70}}],"text":"Arabidopsis embryos lacking DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), which is required for microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, arrest early in development.

mutant embryos exhibit morphological defects and arrest at the globular stage of development (Schwartz et al. 1994). To identify the earliest dcl1 morphological defects, we systematically analyzed dcl1 embryos throughout early embryogenesis. Because dcl1 embryos are not viable, embryos from self-pollinated plants heterozygous for dcl1-5 and dcl1-10, two presumed null alleles (McElver et al. 2001; Schauer et al. 2002), were examined.\nEmbryos developing within a single silique are approximately at the same developmental stage, which enabled an estimate of\ndcl1 embryonic stages based on the morphology of their wild-type siblings. It was reported previously that sus1\/dcl1 embryos exhibit abnormal cell divisions at the base of the embryo proper beginning at the globular stage and in the extraembryonic\nsuspensor beginning at the heart stage (Schwartz et al. 1994). Our morphological analysis of dcl1 embryos confirmed these findings and revealed previously unreported phenotypes (Fig. 1A). We identified initial morphological defects in the presumptive hypophysis cells (i.e., the suspensor cell most proximal\nto the embryo proper) of 19% (29 of 154) of dermatogen stage embryos from self-pollinated dcl1-5\/+ plants (Fig. 1A). By the early globular stage, morphological defects were observed in ∼25% of embryos from selfed dcl1-5\/+ plants (Fig. 1A). These embryos with defects were presumably homozygous for dcl1-5-null alleles, and their defects included abnormal hypophysis cell divisions as well as the previously unreported loss of\npericlinal subprotoderm cell divisions in the embryo proper (Fig. 1A). In subsequent stages, these abnormal embryos did not produce cotyledons and were developmentally arrested and nonviable\n(Fig. 1A; Schwartz et al. 1994). Furthermore, dcl1-5 homozygous seedlings could not be recovered from selfed dcl1-5\/+ plants, which suggested that the developmentally arrested embryos derived from selfed dcl1-5\/+ plants were indeed homozygous for dcl1-5 (data not shown). Because embryos from selfed dcl1-5\/+ and selfed dcl1-10\/+ plants exhibited the same morphological defects at indistinguishable frequencies, subsequent analyses focused on embryos\nfrom selfed dcl1-5\/+ plants (Table 1; data not shown).

next tested whether DCL1 was required for embryonic cell differentiation by examining the expression of cell-specific markers in dcl1-5 embryos. WUSCHEL-related HOMEOBOX2 (WOX2) transcripts are localized in the apical cell lineage of wild-type preglobular embryos (Haecker et al. 2004). After the two\/four-cell stage, WOX2 transcripts were not detected in about a quarter of eight-cell and dermatogen stage embryos (seven of 35 and 14 of 52, respectively)\nfrom self-pollinated dcl1-5\/+ plants (Fig. 1B), which implied that dcl1-5 embryos had undetectable WOX2 expression. Similar to WOX2, PINHEAD\/ZWILLE\/ARGONAUTE10 transcripts, hereafter referred to as PNH, are localized in the apical cell lineage of preglobular embryos (Lynn et al. 1999). Approximately 89% (72 of 81) of eight-cell and dermatogen stage embryos from selfed dcl1-5\/+ plants had detectable levels of PNH transcripts, suggesting that apical cell fate is not completely abolished in all preglobular dcl1 embryos (Supplemental Fig. 2).\nIn contrast to WOX2 and PNH, WOX8 transcripts are localized to the basal cell lineage of preglobular wild-type embryos (Haecker et al. 2004). WOX8 transcripts were detected in 90% (62 of 69) of eight-cell and dermatogen stage embryos from selfed dcl1-5\/+ plants, suggesting that basal cell lineage differentiation is not perturbed in all preglobular dcl1 embryos (Fig. 1B). Thus, dcl1 embryos had detectable defects in the differentiation of apical cell but not basal cell descendents as early as the eight-cell\nstage.\nTo test whether DCL1 is required for radial patterning, we examined a series of markers that are differentially expressed along the radial axis.\nA. thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1 (ATML1) and PROTODERMAL FACTOR1 (PDF1) transcripts are detectable in the protoderm, but not the subprotoderm, of globular stage embryos (Lu et al. 1996; Abe et al. 1999). ATML1 and PDF1 transcripts were appropriately localized to the protoderm of globular stage dcl1-5 embryos, but were ectopically localized in the suspensors of dcl1-5 embryos whose wild-type siblings were at the early heart stage (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. 2). This observation was consistent with the previously reported ectopic localization of embryo proper-specific\nstarch grains and protein bodies in the suspensors of late stage sus1\/dcl1 embryos (Schwartz et al. 1994). Consistent with the reduction\/loss of subprotodermal cell divisions in dcl1 late globular\/early heart stage embryos, we detected reduced levels of RPS5A transcripts in these cell types (Supplemental Fig. 2). Moreover, vascular primordium and ground tissue initial markers were\nabsent from these cell types (Supplemental Fig. 2).\nIn addition to the ectopic localization of protoderm markers in the suspensor, globular dcl1-5 suspensors had reduced levels of WOX8 transcripts (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, hypophysis markers were not detectable in dcl1 globular embryos (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. 2). Considered together with the defective hypophysis cell divisions observed in dcl1 embryos, the lack of hypophysis markers indicates that the hypophysis is misspecified in dcl1 embryos.\nThe plant hormone auxin is transported from the embryo proper to the presumptive hypophysis and contributes to hypophysis\nspecification (Friml et al. 2003; Aida et al. 2004; Weijers et al. 2006). Because the auxin signaling-responsive DR5rev promoter fused to GFP (DR5rev∷GFP) is specifically active in the hypophysis cells of wild-type globular embryos (Friml et al. 2003), and hypophysis specification is perturbed in dcl1 embryos, we examined the activity of DR5rev∷GFP in dcl1-5 embryos to test whether DCL1 was required for appropriate auxin signaling. Although presumptive dcl1-5 hypophysis cells often expressed DR5rev∷GFP, cells located above the presumptive hypophysis ectopically expressed DR5rev∷GFP\n(Fig. 1B). Therefore, DCL1 is required for the hypophysis-specific increase in auxin signaling. Given the severe subprotodermal defects observed in\ndcl1 embryos, the inappropriate auxin signaling observed in dcl1 embryos was likely due to the incorrect expression of auxin transport and\/or auxin signaling factors. Therefore, the auxin\nresponse defects observed in dcl1 embryos were probably secondary consequences of subprotoderm cell differentiation defects, which in turn were probably due\nto the apical cell lineage defects observed at the preglobular stages.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4a67318f","id":"5c371e13","subj":"1db0ec27"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4a67318f","id":"530a8454","subj":"282308c3"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7f4d9395","id":"1e34c607","subj":"33a053d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4fdf8f12","id":"5215cd9a","subj":"4a67318f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4a67318f","id":"3f3ddbd9","subj":"d4ab71a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"50cf5a23","id":"14c053c6","subj":"c1a4620"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"7ba63fe5","id":"6c2d4cc6","subj":"584f5497"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"62d0ac62","id":"6134ac4a","subj":"150d80c4"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6650813a","id":"777c9dc9","subj":"13cda7c9"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"76f10035","id":"71b1a49c","subj":"2fb69ff6"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5987e932","id":"73e132e0","subj":"438bad7c"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"3e1162e7","id":"3773862a","subj":"2b50150"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5bbbdd4b","id":"2a415aa9","subj":"5987e932"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"76b0ae1b","id":"53cdecf6","subj":"c1a4620"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4943defe","id":"71ea1fda","subj":"33a053d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6979efad","id":"62b3df3a","subj":"4a67318f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"50cf5a23","id":"3003697","subj":"4c432866"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"1db0ec27","id":"1d269ed7","subj":"d4ab71a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6f330eb9","id":"41c89d2f","subj":"584f5497"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"76f10035","id":"410e94e","subj":"4e406694"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"30457e14","id":"2d691f3d","subj":"13cda7c9"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"438bad7c","id":"1bdbf9be","subj":"27f0ad19"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"438bad7c","id":"1e7f2e0f","subj":"1ad777f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4f8caaf3","id":"78d39a69","subj":"3e1162e7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"282308c3","id":"5b69d40d","subj":"d4ab71a"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"76b0ae1b","id":"49298ce7","subj":"4c432866"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5bbbdd4b","id":"503fbbc6","subj":"27f0ad19"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5bbbdd4b","id":"109f5dd8","subj":"1ad777f"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"68ace111","id":"36b6964d","subj":"6759f091"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"240139e1","id":"31198ceb","subj":"1d8e2eea"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"6759f091","id":"9257031","subj":"7cf7aee"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"37ff4054","id":"54f5f647","subj":"df4b72"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"6759f091","id":"5a6d5a8f","subj":"1f9d6c7b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"6759f091","id":"420745d7","subj":"14a54ef6"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"253c1256","id":"7e11ab3d","subj":"240139e1"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"56bc3fac","id":"2392212b","subj":"37ff4054"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"7d2a6eac","id":"30865a90","subj":"2472c7d8"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"2472c7d8","id":"437ebf59","subj":"232024b9"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"273c947f","id":"5fa47fea","subj":"1af1347d"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"77e2a6e2","id":"28f8e165","subj":"6105f8a3"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"55b62629","id":"5b43e173","subj":"a53bb6f"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"29b732a2","id":"6594402a","subj":"1b70203f"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"60222fd8","id":"405325cf","subj":"48d7ad8b"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"2237bada","id":"79c3f01f","subj":"199e4c2b"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"66f66866","id":"350b3a17","subj":"236ab296"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"5aa6202e","id":"669d2b1b","subj":"2516fc68"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"51671b08","id":"721eb7df","subj":"15051a0"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"63a5d002","id":"1ea9f009","subj":"2516fc68"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"20765ed5","id":"5d52e3ef","subj":"199e4c2b"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"7d2a6eac","id":"5298dead","subj":"2c0f7678"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"718607eb","id":"553f3b6e","subj":"894858"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"73386d72","id":"6bb7cce7","subj":"718607eb"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"5d10455d","id":"6b530eb9","subj":"2617f816"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"737edcfa","id":"678040b3","subj":"718607eb"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"7f34a967","id":"64a1923a","subj":"4aa3d36"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"3b0f7d9d","id":"18ca3c62","subj":"236ab296"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"26f3d90c","id":"44d70181","subj":"1162410a"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"4943defe","id":"6aa648b9","subj":"181d7f28"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"5710768a","id":"23c650a3","subj":"2237bada"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"5710768a","id":"742d4e15","subj":"20765ed5"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"30272916","id":"88a8218","subj":"26f3d90c"},{"pred":"Is_Localized_In","obj":"2d83c5a5","id":"710b30ef","subj":"3e681

However, other pieces of the puzzle are missing, in particular the genes that repress maturation during early embryogenesis.\nThe data presented here strongly suggest that miRNAs are these key negative regulators of the maturation program. In dcl1-15 embryos, we observed early chloroplast maturation and early accumulation of starch grains, lipid bodies, and storage proteins.\nOur conclusion is reinforced by the transcriptional profile of dcl1-15 torpedo stage embryos, which resembles that of older embryos. Similarly, Nodine and Bartel (2010) described the early accumulation of OLEOSIN transcripts and a heterochronic change in the transcriptional profile in dcl1-5 embryos. Interestingly, even though the maturation program starts too early, the timing of the different components of the\nprogram seems to be unaffected. In particular, we still see accumulation of chlorophyll preceding the expression of the seed\nstorage protein At2S3, as in wild-type embryos.

of Repressors of the Maturation Program during Embryogenesis\nOne lingering mystery has been the identity of the genes directly repressing the maturation program early in development.\nOur microarray analysis indicated that ASIL1, HDA6\/SIL1, and CLF were down-regulated in dcl1-15. These genes have previously been shown to repress the transcription of the LEC genes and other maturation-related genes in seedlings. Interestingly, several other histone deacetylases were down-regulated\n(HDA5, -9, -10, and HDT1) as well as the closest homolog to ASIL1 (ASIL2). It has already been shown that ASIL1 binds to a GT-box, which is present in both the promoters of the LEC genes and of\nthe genes encoding storage products, regulating the program at least at two levels (Gao et al., 2009). We analyzed single and double mutant combinations of asil1-1, asil2-1, and sil1-1 and found that these genes redundantly repress the maturation program during early embryogenesis, downstream of miRNA targets.\nThus, our studies demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that the same genetic mechanism negatively regulates seed\nstorage genes during early embryogenesis and seedling development.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5767b2af","id":"7f9e1534","subj":"1286528d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5767b2af","id":"138a7441","subj":"33a630fa"},{"pred":"Regulates_Expression","obj":"5767b2af","id":"81ff872","subj":"265c5d69"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"4ad4936c","id":"31611954","subj":"3887cf88"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"3887cf88","id":"3e598df9","subj":"4fcc529"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"3887cf88","id":"7e31ce0f","subj":"25cc7470"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"5649ec46","id":"20d11153","subj":"3887cf88"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"42cc13a0","id":"3088660d","subj":"30e92cb9"},{"pred":"Has_Sequence_Identical_To","obj":"3cc20577","id":"32fdec40","subj":"1286528d"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"39ab59f8","id":"1bd81830","subj":"99a65d3"},{"pred":"Composes_Primary_Structure","obj":"6813a331","id":"4beddc56","subj":"39ab59f8"},{"pred":"Composes_Primary_Structure","obj":"39ab59f8","id":"79b663b3","subj":"111610e6"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"7b22ec89","id":"1b812421","subj":"48b0e701"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"7b22ec89","id":"5d28bcd5","subj":"2228db21"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"7b22ec89","id":"7882c44a","subj":"241a0c3a"},{"pred":"Transcribes_Or_Translates_To","obj":"7b22ec89","id":"32639b12","subj":"547c04c4"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"SeeDev-binary-21635767-1","denotations":[{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"6f63c44f","span":{"end":889,"begin":885}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"62a8fd44","span":{"end":882,"begin":855}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"6b04acb2","span":{"end":898,"begin":895}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"58faa93b","span":{"end":1154,"begin":1150}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"5f212d84","span":{"end":1127,"begin":1114}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"4dd94a58","span":{"end":370,"begin":362}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"a8a8b75","span":{"end":396,"begin":375}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"72be135f","span":{"end":1176,"begin":1156}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"51e37590","span":{"end":1264,"begin":1243}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"701a32","span":{"end":1238,"begin":1230}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"39aa45a1","span":{"end":615,"begin":611}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"4c060c8f","span":{"end":683,"begin":675}},{"obj":"Protein_Family","id":"49b07ee3","span":{"end":853,"begin":850}},{"obj":"Box","id":"5f5b5ca4","span":{"end":945,"begin":938}},{"obj":"Box","id":"1d035be3","span":{"end":1002,"begin":947}},{"obj":"Box","id":"4a60ee36","span":{"end":1102,"begin":1097}},{"obj":"Box","id":"27ead29e","span":{"end":759,"begin":729}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"18388a3c","span":{"end":1081,"begin":1032}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"4bd2f0dc","span":{"end":1264,"begin":1202}},{"obj":"Promoter","id":"2e647e59","span":{"end":1238,"begin":1202}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"4cfbaf4","span":{"end":1075,"begin":1052}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"3249a1ce","span":{"end":284,"begin":253}},{"obj":"Pathway","id":"deb3b60","span":{"end":510,"begin":478}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"127d7908","span":{"end":87,"begin":76}},{"obj":"Genotype","id":"6b9c69a9","span":{"end":109,"begin":89}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"6622a690","span":{"end":116,"begin":111}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"412c995d","span":{"end":151,"begin":145}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"155d1021","span":{"end":379,"begin":375}},{"obj":"Tissue","id":"27cbfddf","span":{"end":1247,"begin":1243}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"30b9eadd","span":{"end":158,"begin":126}},{"obj":"Development_Phase","id":"497570fb","span":{"end":158,"begin":138}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"2c42b421","span":{"end":568,"begin":536}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"73aff8f1","span":{"end":575,"begin":570}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"40620d8e","span":{"end":847,"begin":830}},{"obj":"Protein","id":"383f3558","span":{"end":828,"begin":824}}],"text":"We identified gene coexpression networks in the transcriptome of developing Arabidopsis\n(Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds from the globular to mature embryo stages by analyzing publicly accessible\nmicroarray datasets.

two apparently critical residues are located within a stretch of more than 100 amino acids, about one-third of the FUS3 sequence, which exhibits significant sequence similarity to a distinct domain, B3 or basic region 3 (Giraudat et al. 1992), characteristic of VP1\/ABI3-like proteins. These factors are transcriptional regulators, most of them involved in the control of seed maturation (Bobb et al. 1995 ;Hattori et al. 1994 ;Hoecker et al. 1995 ;McCarty et al. 1991 ;Nakagawa et al. 1996 ;Nambara et al. 1992 ;Nambara et al. 1995 ;Ooms et al. 1993 ;Parcy et al. 1994). Recently, a group of transcription factors involved in auxin-dependent gene regulation has been described (Ulmasov et al. 1997). However, the B3 domains present in several of these proteins have less resemblance to FUS3, VP1, ABI3 (Fig. 5a), as well as to the presumed VP1\/ABI3 orthologs of rice and bean (Bobb et al. 1995 ;Hattori et al. 1994) which can be grouped together.\nIt is known that the B3 domain of VP1, when taken out of its native context, binds in vitro to the DNA element TCCATGCAT (Suzuki et al. 1997). It is likely, therefore, that the B3 domain of FUS3 similarly mediates binding to specific promoter sequences (Bäumlein et al. 1994). The same applies to ABI3 (Nambara et al. 1995 ;Parcy et al. 1994). During embryogenesis the FUS3 transcript becomes detectable 2 d.a.p. paralleled by the appearance of the ABI3 mRNA. The finding of co-expression at differing levels, however, is consistent with the fact that FUS3 and ABI3, in a combinatorial and synergistic fashion, control overlapping yet not identical aspects of Arabidopsis seed maturation (Parcy et al. 1997). Future studies will have to elucidate to what extent structural similarities of FUS3 and ABI3 contribute to this synergism.\nSo far, FUS3 is the smallest member of the protein family characterized by VP1\/ABI3-like B3 domains (Fig. 6). VP1 and ABI3, as well as their presumed orthologs in bean (Bobb et al. 1995) or rice (Hattori et al. 1994), have two additional basic domains, B1 and B2 (Giraudat et al. 1992 ;Hill et al. 1996), preceding B3. In FUS3, B1 is absent but, to a small extent, there is sequence similarity to B2 (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the C-terminal portion of FUS3 downstream of the B3 domain includes an acidic stretch and an amide sequence typically found in transcriptional activation domains. Such properties have indeed been shown for the N-terminal acidic portions of VP1 and the bean VP1\/ABI3 ortholog (Bobb et al. 1995 ;McCarty et al. 1991).\n","relations":[{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"6331250e","id":"469d003c","subj":"5173200b"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"1813f3e9","id":"6b410923","subj":"30feffc"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"6a933be2","id":"1d3e6d34","subj":"585ac855"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"67207d8a","id":"26a94fa5","subj":"3b152928"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"69c6161d","id":"3bc735b3","subj":"1450078a"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"3b152928","id":"757529a4","subj":"30feffc"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"67207d8a","id":"2234078","subj":"1813f3e9"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"67207d8a","id":"6bff19ff","subj":"378bd86d"},{"pred":"Is_Protein_Domain_Of","obj":"378bd86d","id":"41e1455d","subj":"30feffc"},{"pred":"Exists_At_Stage","obj":"41477a6d","id":"203dd56b","subj":"3eb631b8"},{"pred":"Exists_At_Stage","obj":"66908383","id":"6d64b553","subj":"41477a6d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Process","obj":"6a933be2","id":"4e558728","subj":"3eba57a7"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"591fd34d","id":"5eccd3b9","subj":"29a23c3d"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"591fd34d","id":"6ef7623","subj":"534ca02b"},{"pred":"Regulates_Development_Phase","obj":"591fd34d","id":"17ca8b92","subj":"4b6ac111"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"644abb8f","id":"4d6f197e","subj":"2189e7a7"},{"pred":"Is_Functionally_Equivalent_To","obj":"5bb8f9e2","id":"5c089b2f","subj":"585ac855"},{"pred":"Binds_To","obj":"779de014","id":"64e1dd11","subj":"577f9109"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"5ec77191","id":"6999cd39","subj":"577f9109"},{"pred":"Interacts_With","obj":"779de014","id":"61e45f87","subj":"5ec77191"},{"pred":"Is_Member_Of_Family","obj":"3b0ca5e1","id":"14bae047","subj":"1ec7d8b3"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"534ca02b","id":"7c9b78e3","subj":"4b6ac111"},{"pred":"Exists_In_Genotype","obj":"4b6ac111","id":"3068b369","subj":"29a23c3d"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"}]
